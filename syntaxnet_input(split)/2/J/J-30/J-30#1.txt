Liad Blumrosen School of Engineering and Computer Science The Hebrew University Jerusalem , Israel liad @ cs.huji.ac.il Michal Feldman School of Engineering and Computer Science The Hebrew University Jerusalem , Israel mfeldman @ cs.huji.ac.il ABSTRACT While traditional mechanism design typically assumes isomorphism between the agents '' type and action spaces , in many situations the agents face strict restrictions on their action space due to , e.g. , technical , behavioral or regulatory reasons .
