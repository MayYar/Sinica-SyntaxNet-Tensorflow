Input: The hardness results are surprising especially in light of the observation that a pair betting market has a seemingly more restrictive bidding language which only offers n -LRB- n ? 1 -RRB- 1 The notion of perfect matching in a bipartite graph , which we use only in this proof , should not be confused with the notion of matching bets which we use throughout the paper .
