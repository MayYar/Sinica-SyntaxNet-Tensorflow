Input: It would however be beyond the scope of this paper to implement and test the full suite of metrics listed in -LRB- 9 -RRB- , and thus in order to provide a useful non random subset , we chose to implement the minimum set of metrics necessary to implement local and global adaptation -LRB- 9 -RRB- and thereby satisfy a range of real adaptation scenarios .
