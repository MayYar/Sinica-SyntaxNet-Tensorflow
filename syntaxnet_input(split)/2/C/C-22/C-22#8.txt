Input: Clearly , it is not practical to measure metrics and perform adaptation on objects with short execution times that can not benefit from remote execution on hosts with greater processing power , thereby offsetting IT overhead of remote compared with local execution as well as the cost of object migration and the metrics collection process itself .
