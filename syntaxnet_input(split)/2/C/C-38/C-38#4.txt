Input: Gossiping -LRB- or rumor spreading -RRB- has been frequently used as a scalable alternative to flooding that gradually spreads information among a group of peers.However , we use gossiping as a search mechanism -LRB- 9 -RRB- for finding promising parents since it has two appealing properties -LRB- i -RRB- the volume of exchanged messages can be controlled , and -LRB- ii -RRB- the gossip based information exchange can be customized to leverage relative utility values to improve search efficiency .
