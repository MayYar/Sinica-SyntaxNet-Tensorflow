Input: outperforms a simple strategy with none of these features -LRB- within an heterogenous population the advertising agents who use the advanced bidding strategy are able to expose their adverts to 25 % more users than those using the simple bidding strategy -RRB- , and we show that it performs within 7.5 % of that of a centralised optimiser with perfect knowledge of the number of users who will arrival and depart in all future advertising cycles .
