Input: The traditional task allocation problem , TAP -LRB- without the condition of the social network SN -RRB- , is NP complete -LRB- 18 -RRB- , and the complexity comes from the fact that we need to evaluate the exponential number of subsets of the task set .

Input: Although we may consider the TAP as a special case of the STAP by assuming agents are fully connected , we can not directly use the complexity results from the TAP , since we study the STAP in an arbitrary social network , which , as we argued in the introduction , should be partially connected .
