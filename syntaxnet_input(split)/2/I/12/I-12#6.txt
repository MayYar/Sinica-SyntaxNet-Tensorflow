Input: For the Figure 4 environment , average all is a good strategy for agents of type II , IV and V , because the theoretical reservation value of each of these types is close to the one obtained based on the aggregated distribution function -LRB- i.e. , 21.27 -RRB- .4 However , for types I and III for which the optimal RV differs from that value , the average all method performs significantly worse .
