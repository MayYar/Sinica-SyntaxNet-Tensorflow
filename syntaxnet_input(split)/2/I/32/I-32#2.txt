Input: Early research in multiagent systems considered cooperative groups of agents ; because individual agents had limited resources , or limited access to information -LRB- e.g. , limited processing power , limited sensor coverage -RRB- , they worked together by design to solve problems that individually they could not solve , or at least could not solve as efficiently .
