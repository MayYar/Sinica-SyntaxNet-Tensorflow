Input: Using the key notions of a limited communication network , a simple learning process , and a satisficing heuristic that may be subject to external constraints , we showed -LRB- 1 -RRB- the importance of word of mouth communication to both system effectiveness and stability , -LRB- 2 -RRB- that the degree distribution of a network is more influential than the way in which agents are connected , but that both are important in more complex environments , -LRB- 3 -RRB- that rewiring even a small number of connections to create a small world network can have dramatic results for the speed of convergence to satisficing distributions and market share allocations , -LRB- 4 -RRB- that word of mouth continues to be effective when movements between products are constrained by market barriers , and -LRB- 5 -RRB- that increases in negative word of mouth incurred as a result of market barriers can reduce the market share collectively captured by leading brands , but that this is dependent on the existence of a suitably well connected network structure
