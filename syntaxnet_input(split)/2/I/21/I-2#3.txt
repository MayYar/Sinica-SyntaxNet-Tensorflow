Input: choosing an alternative that is on average better than another -RRB- , finding that conformity of behaviour arises when agents are exposed to word of mouth communication from only a small number of other agents , but that this conformity may result in socially inefficient outcomes where the tendency toward conformity is so strong that it overwhelms the influence of the superior payoffs provided by the socially efficient outcome .

Input: The simulation framework allows for a more complex modelling of the environment than the analytical models , in which referrals are at random and only two choices are available , and the work in -LRB- 6 -RRB- in particular is a close antecedent of the work presented in this paper , our main contribution being to include network structure and the constraints imposed by market barriers as additional effects .

Input: While the formalisation of the idea that satisfaction drives purchase behaviour can be traced back to the work of Fishbein and Ajzen -LRB- 9 -RRB- on reasoned choice , nearly all writers , including Fishbein and Ajzen , recognise that this relationship can be thwarted by circumstances -LRB- e.g .
