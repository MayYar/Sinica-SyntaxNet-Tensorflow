Input: While coalition formation models usually consider general coalition sizes -LRB- 24 -RRB- , the partnership formation model -LRB- often referred as matchmaking -RRB- considers environments where agents have a benefit only when forming a partnership and this benefit can not be improved by extending the partnership to more than two agents -LRB- 12 , 23 -RRB- -LRB- e.g. , in the case of buyers and sellers or peer to peer applications -RRB- .

Input: Several of the two sided search essences can be found in the strategic theory of bargaining -LRB- 3 -RRB- both coalition formation and matching can be represented as a sequential bargaining game -LRB- 4 -RRB- in which payoffs are defined as a function of the coalition structure and can be divided according to a fixed or negotiated division rule .
