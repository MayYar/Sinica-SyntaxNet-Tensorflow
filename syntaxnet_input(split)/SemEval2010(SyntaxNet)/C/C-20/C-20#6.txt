Input: We proposed new network functions to enable server migration and replication across wide area networks -LRB- such as the Internet or a geographically distributed virtual private network -RRB- , and finally showed the utility of intelligent and dynamic storage replication technology to ensure applications have access to data in the face of outages with very tight recovery point objectives .
