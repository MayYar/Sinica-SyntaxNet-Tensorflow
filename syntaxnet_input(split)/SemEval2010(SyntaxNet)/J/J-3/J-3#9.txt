Input: -LRB- A conversion corresponds to an action on the part of the user who clicked through to the advertiser site ; e.g. , a sale or an account sign up. -RRB- Finally , we have looked at this system as a black box returning clicks as a function of bid , whereas in reality it is a complex repeated game involving multiple advertisers
