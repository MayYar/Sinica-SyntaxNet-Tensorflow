Input: STRUCTURED ITEM GRAPHS Given that the class C -LRB- hw , k -RRB- has been shown to be an island of tractability for the winner determination problem , and given that the class C -LRB- ig , k -RRB- has been shown not to be efficiently recognizable , one may be inclined to think that there are instances having unbounded hypertree width , but admitting an item graph of bounded tree width -LRB- so that the intractability of structured item graphs would lie in their generality -RRB- .
