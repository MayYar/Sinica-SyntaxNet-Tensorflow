Input: At each step of a simulation , each of the CAs samples its owner -LRB- i.e. , all CAs in the system collect data at a similar rate -RRB- and then estimates the parameter -LRB- either the expected cost when using the sequential interruption technique described in Section 2 or the probability that the owner will have the required information -RRB- using one of the following methods
