We follow the language modeling approach, and base our method on the KL divergence retrieval model proposed in [25] .
With this model, the retrieval task involves estimating a query language model £cq from a given query, a document language model £cd from each document, and calculating their KL divergence D(£cq||£cd), which is then used to score the documents .
[25] treats relevance feedback as a query model re estimation problem, i.e., computing an updated query model £cq given the original query text and the extra evidence carried by the judged relevant documents .
We adopt this view, and cast our task as updating the query model from user term feedback .
There are two key subtasks here
Second, how to compute an updated query model based on this term feedback evidence, so that it captures the user"s information need and translates into good retrieval performance. .
