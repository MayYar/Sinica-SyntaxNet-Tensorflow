TDT4 was the benchmark corpus used in TDT2002 and TDT2003 evaluations .
The corpus consists of over 90, 000 news articles from multiple sources (AP, NYT, CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, Xinhua, Zaobao, Voice of America, PRI the World, etc.) published between October 2000 and January 2001, in the languages of Arabic, English, and Mandarin .
Speech recognized and machine translated versions of the non English articles were provided as well .
LDC [18] has annotated the corpus with 100 topics, that correspond to various news events in this time period .
Out of these, we selected a subset of 12 actionable events, and defined corresponding tasks for them4 .
For each task, we manually defined a profile consisting of an initial set of (5 to 10) queries, a free text description of the user history, i.e., what the user already knows about the event, and a list of known on topic and off topic documents (if available) as training examples .
For each query, we generated answer keys and corresponding nugget matching rules using the procedure described in section 4.1.2, and produced a total of 120 queries, with an average of 7 nuggets per query. .
