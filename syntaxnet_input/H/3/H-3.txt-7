There are several parameters in our model
As the parameter £f only affects document model, we will set it to the same value in all our experiments .
The value £f=0.5 is determined to maximize the effectiveness of the baseline models (see Section 7.2) on the training data
The mixture weights £\i of component models are trained on the same training data using the following method of line search [11] to maximize the Mean Average Precision (MAP)
We start by searching in one direction testing all the values in that direction, while keeping the values in other directions unchanged .
Each direction is searched in turn, until no improvement in MAP is observed .
In order to avoid being trapped at a local maximum, we started from 10 random points and the best setting is selected. .
