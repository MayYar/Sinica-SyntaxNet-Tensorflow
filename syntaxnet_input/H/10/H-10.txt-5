In this section, experiments are conducted to empirically compare the clustering results of CLGR with other 8 representitive document clustering algorithms on 5 datasets .
First we will introduce the basic informations of those datasets .
3.1 Datasets We use a variety of datasets, most of which are frequently used in the information retrieval research .
Table 2 summarizes the characteristics of the datasets .
4 Here an indication matrix T is a n¡Ñc matrix with its (i, j)th entry Tij ? {0, 1} such that for each row of Q? there is only one 1 .
Then the xi can be assigned to the j th cluster such that j = argjQ? ij = 1 .
