than £c init+(h 1)£_ , then add di to the tree as a direct child of r .
Otherwise, if n is a terminal node, then create a cluster node instead of n, and add both n and di as its direct children; if n is an non terminal node, then repeat this procedure and insert di to the sub tree with n as root recursively .
Here h is the length between n and the root of S tree .
The more the stories in a cluster similar to each other, the better the cluster represents the stories in it .
Hence we add no constraints on the maximum of tree"s height and degree of a node .
Therefore, we cannot give the complexity of this indexing tree based procedure .
But we will give the number of comparing times needed by the new procedure in our experiments in section7. .
