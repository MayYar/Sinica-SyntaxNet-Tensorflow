2 INTRODUCTION :
2-1:Over the last few years there have been increasing interests in studying how to control the search processes in peer to peer(P2P) based information retrieval(IR) systems [6, 13, 14, 15] .
2-2:In this line of research, one of the core problems that concerns researchers is to efficiently route user queries in the network to agents that are in possession of appropriate documents .
2-3:In the absence of global information, the dominant strategies in addressing this problem are content similarity based approaches [6, 13, 14, 15] .
2-4:While the content similarity between queries and local nodes appears to be a creditable indicator for the number of relevant documents residing on each node, these approaches are limited by a number of factors .
2-5:First of all, similaritybased metrics can be myopic since locally relevant nodes may not be connected to other relevant nodes .
2-6:Second, the similarity based approaches do not take into account the run time characteristics of the P2P IR systems, including environmental parameters, bandwidth usage, and the historical information of the past search sessions, that provide valuable information for the query routing algorithms .
2-7:In this paper, we develop a reinforcement learning based IR approach for improving the performance of distributed IR search algorithms .
2-8:Agents can acquire better search strategies by collecting and analyzing feedback information from previous search sessions .
2-9:Particularly, agents maintain estimates, namely expected utility, on the downstream agents" capabilities of providing relevant documents for specific types of incoming queries .
2-10:These estimates are updated gradually by learning from the feedback information returned from previous search sessions .
2-11:Based on the updated expected utility information, the agents derive corresponding routing policies .
2-12:Thereafter, these agents route the queries based on the learned policies and update the estimates on the expected utility based on the new routing policies .
2-13:This process is conducted in an iterative manner .
2-14:The goal of the learning algorithm, even though it consumes some network bandwidth, is to shorten the routing time so that more queries are processed per time unit while at the same time finding more relevant documents .
2-15:This contrasts with the content similarity based approaches where similar operations are repeated for every incoming query and the processing time keeps largely constant over time .
2-16:Another way of viewing this paper is that our basic approach to distributed IR search is to construct a hierarchical overlay network(agent organization) based on the contentsimilarity measure among agents" document collections in a bottom up fashion .
2-17:In the past work, we have shown that this organization improves search performance significantly .
2-18:However, this organizational structure does not take into account the arrival patterns of queries, including their frequency, types, and where they enter the system, nor the available communication bandwidth of the network and processing capabilities of individual agents .
2-19:The intention of the reinforcement learning is to adapt the agents" routing decisions to the dynamic network situations and learn from past search sessions .
2-20:Specifically, the contributions of this paper include: (1) a reinforcement learning based approach for agents to acquire satisfactory routing policies based on estimates of the potential contribution of their neighboring agents; (2) two strategies to speed up the learning process .
2-21:To our best knowledge, this is one of the first reinforcement learning applications in addressing distributed content sharing problems and it is indicative of some of the issues in applying reinforcement in a complex application .
2-22:The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the hierarchical content sharing systems and the two phase search algorithm based on such topology .
2-23:Section 3 describes a reinforcement learning based approach to direct the routing process; Section 4 details the experimental settings and analyze the results .
2-24:Section 5 discusses related studies and Section 6 concludes the paper. .
3 SEARCH IN HIERARCHICAL P2P IR SYSTEMS :
3-1:P2P IR SYSTEMS This section briefly reviews our basic approaches to hierarchical P2P IR systems .
3-2:In a hierarchical P2P IR system illustrated in Fig.1, agents are connected to each other through three types of links: upward links, downward links, and lateral links .
3-3:In the following sections, we denote the set of agents that are directly connected to agent Ai as DirectConn(Ai), which is defined as DirectConn(Ai) = NEI(Ai) ∪ PAR(Ai) ∪ CHL(Ai) , where NEI(Ai) is the set of neighboring agents connected to Ai through lateral links; PAR(Ai) is the set of agents whom agent Ai is connected to through upward links and CHL(Ai) is the set of agents that agent Ai connects to through downward links .
3-4:These links are established through a bottom up content similarity based distributed clustering process[15] .
3-5:These links are then used by agents to locate other agents that contain documents relevant to the given queries .
3-6:A typical agent Ai in our system uses two queues: a local search queue, LSi, and a message forwarding queue MFi .
3-7:The states of the two queues constitute the internal states of an agent .
3-8:The local search queue LSi stores search sessions that are scheduled for local processing .
3-9:It is a priority queue and agent Ai always selects the most promising queries to process in order to maximize the global utility .
3-10:MFi consists of a set of queries to forward on and is processed in a FIFO (first in first out) fashion .
3-11:For the first query in MFi, agent Ai determines which subset of its neighboring agents to forward it to based on the agent"s routing policy πi .
3-12:These routing decisions determine how the search process is conducted in the network .
3-13:In this paper, we call Ai as Aj"s upstream agent and Aj as Ai"s downstream agent if A4 A5 A6 A7 A2 A3 A9 NEI(A2)={A3} PAR(A2)={A1} CHL(A2)={A4,A5} A1 A8 Figure 1: A fraction of a hierarchical P2PIR system an agent Ai routes a query to agent Aj .
3-14:The distributed search protocol of our hierarchical agent organization is composed of two steps .
3-15:In the first step, upon receipt of a query qk at time tl from a user, agent Ai initiates a search session si by probing its neighboring agents Aj ∈ NEI(Ai) with the message PROBE for the similarity value Sim(qk, Aj) between qk and Aj .
3-16:Here, Ai is defined as the query initiator of search session si .
3-17:In the second step, Ai selects a group of the most promising agents to start the actual search process with the message SEARCH .
3-18:These SEARCH messages contain a TTL (Time To Live) parameter in addition to the query .
3-19:The TTL value decreases by 1 after each hop .
3-20:In the search process, agents discard those queries that either have been previously processed or whose TTL drops to 0, which prevents queries from looping in the system forever .
3-21:The search session ends when all the agents that receive the query drop it or TTL decreases to 0 .
3-22:Upon receipt of SEARCH messages for qk, agents schedule local activities including local searching, forwarding qk to their neighbors, and returning search results to the query initiator .
3-23:This process and related algorithms are detailed in [15, 14]. .
4 A BASIC REINFORCEMENTLEARNING BASED SEARCH APPROACH :
4-1:BASED SEARCH APPROACH In the aforementioned distributed search algorithm, the routing decisions of an agent Ai rely on the similarity comparison between incoming queries and Ai"s neighboring agents in order to forward those queries to relevant agents without flooding the network with unnecessary query messages .
4-2:However, this heuristic is myopic because a relevant direct neighbor is not necessarily connected to other relevant agents .
4-3:In this section, we propose a more general approach by framing this problem as a reinforcement learning task .
4-4:In pursuit of greater flexibility, agents can switch between two modes: learning mode and non learning mode .
4-5:In the non learning mode, agents operate in the same way as they do in the normal distributed search processes described in [14, 15] .
4-6:On the other hand, in the learning mode, in parallel with distributed search sessions, agents also participate in a learning process which will be detailed in this section .
4-7:Note that in the learning protocol, the learning process does not interfere with the distributed search process .
4-8:Agents can choose to initiate and stop learning processes without affecting the system performance .
4-9:In particular, since the learning process consumes network resources (especially bandwidth), agents can choose to initiate learning only when the network load is relatively low, thus minimizing the extra communication costs incurred by the learning algorithm .
4-10:The section is structured as follows, Section 3.1 describes 232 The Sixth Intl .
4-11:Joint Conf .
4-12:on Autonomous Agents and Multi Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) a reinforcement learning based model .
4-13:Section 3.2 describes a protocol to deploy the learning algorithm in the network .
4-14:Section 3.3 discusses the convergence of the learning algorithm .
4-15:3.1 The Model An agent"s routing policy takes the state of a search session as input and output the routing actions for that query .
4-16:In our work, the state of a search session sj is stipulated as: QSj = (qk, ttlj) where ttlj is the number of hops that remains for the search session sj , qk is the specific query .
4-17:QL is an attribute of qk that indicates which type of queries qk most likely belong to .
4-18:The set of QL can be generated by running a simple online classification algorithm on all the queries that have been processed by the agents, or an oﬄine algorithm on a pre designated training set .
4-19:The assumption here is that the set of query types is learned ahead of time and belongs to the common knowledge of the agents in the network .
4-20:Future work includes exploring how learning can be accomplished when this assumption does not hold .
4-21:Given the query types set, an incoming query qi can be classified to one query class Q(qi) by the formula: Q(qi) = arg max Qj P(qi|Qj) (1) where P(qi|Qj ) indicates the likelihood that the query qi is generated by the query class Qj [8] .
4-22:The set of atomic routing actions of an agent Ai is denoted as {αi}, where {αi} is defined as αi = {αi0 , αi1 , ..., αin } .
4-23:An element αij represents an action to route a given query to the neighboring agent Aij ∈ DirectConn(Ai) .
4-24:The routing policy πi of agent Ai is stochastic and its outcome for a search session with state QSj is defined as: πi(QSj) = {(αi0 , πi(QSi, αi0 )), (αi1 , πi(QSi, αi1 )), ...} (2) Note that operator πi is overloaded to represent either the probabilistic policy for a search session with state QSj, denoted as πi(QSj); or the probability of forwarding the query to a specific neighboring agent Aik ∈ DirectConn(Ai) under the policy πi(QSj), denoted as πi(QSj, αik ) .
4-25:Therefore, equation (2) means that the probability of forwarding the search session to agent Ai0 is πi(QSi, αi0 ) and so on .
4-26:Under this stochastic policy, the routing action is nondeterministic .
4-27:The advantage of such a strategy is that the best neighboring agents will not be selected repeatedly, thereby mitigating the potential hot spots situations .
4-28:The expected utility, Un i (QSj), is used to estimate the potential utility gain of routing query type QSj to agent Ai under policy πn i .
4-29:The superscript n indicates the value at the nth iteration in an iterative learning process .
4-30:The expected utility provides routing guidance for future search sessions .
4-31:In the search process, each agent Ai maintains partial observations of its neighbors" states, as shown in Fig .
4-32:2 .
4-33:The partial observation includes non local information such as the potential utility estimation of its neighbor Am for query state QSj, denoted as Um(QSj), as well as the load information, Lm .
4-34:These observations are updated periodically by the neighbors .
4-35:The estimated utility information will be used to update Ai"s expected utility for its routing policy .

4-43:QS0 QS1 .. .
4-44:Figure 2: Agent Ai"s Partial Observation about its neighbors(A0, A1...) The load information of Am, Lm, is defined as Lm = |MFm| Cm , where |MFm| is the length of the message forward queue and Cm is the service rate of agent Am"s message forward queue .
4-45:Therefore Lm characterizes the utilization of an agent"s communication channel, and thus provide non local information for Am"s neighbors to adjust the parameters of their routing policy to avoid inundating their downstream agents .
4-46:Note that based on the characteristics of the queries entering the system and agents" capabilities, the loading of agents may not be uniform .
4-47:After collecting the utilization rate information from all its neighbors, agent Ai computes Li as a single measure for assessing the average load condition of its neighborhood: Li = P k Lk |DirectConn(Ai)| Agents exploit Li value in determining the routing probability in its routing policy .
4-48:Note that, as described in Section 3.2, information about neighboring agents is piggybacked with the query message propagated among the agents whenever possible to reduce the traffic overhead .
4-49:3.1.1 Update the Policy An iterative update process is introduced for agents to learn a satisfactory stochastic routing policy .
4-50:In this iterative process, agents update their estimates on the potential utility of their current routing policies and then propagate the updated estimates to their neighbors .
4-51:Their neighbors then generate a new routing policy based on the updated observation and in turn they calculate the expected utility based on the new policies and continue this iterative process .
4-52:In particular, at time n, given a set of expected utility, an agent Ai, whose directly connected agents set is DirectConn(Ai) = {Ai0 , ..., Aim }, determines its corresponding stochastic routing policy for a search session of state QSj based on the following steps: (1) Ai first selects a subset of agents as the potential downstream agents from set DirectConn(Ai), denoted as PDn(Ai, QSj) .
4-53:The size of the potential downstream agent is specified as |PDn(Ai, QSj)| = min(|NEI(Ai), dn i + k)| where k is a constant and is set to 3 in this paper; dn i , the forward width, is defined as the expected number of The Sixth Intl .
4-54:Joint Conf .
4-55:on Autonomous Agents and Multi Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 233 neighboring agents that agent Ai can forward to at time agent set PDn(Ai, QSj) is either the subset of neighboring agents with dn i + k highest expected utility value for state QSj among all the agents in DirectConn(Ai), or all their neighboring agents .
4-56:The k is introduced based on the idea of a stochastic routing policy and it makes the forwarding probability of the dn i +k highest agent less than 100% .
4-57:Note that if we want to limit the number of downstream agents for search session sj as 5, the probability of forwarding the query to all neighboring agents should add up to 5 .
4-58:Setting up dn i value properly can improve the utilization rate of the network bandwidth when much of the network is idle while mitigating the traffic load when the network is highly loaded .
4-59:The dn+1 i value is updated based on dn i , the previous and current observations on the traffic situation in the neighborhood .
4-60:Specifically, the update formula for dn+1 i is dn+1 i = dn i ∗ (1 + 1 − Li |DirectConn(Ai)| ) In this formula, the forward width is updated based on the traffic conditions of agent Ai"s neighborhood, i.e Li, and its previous value .
4-61:(2) For each agent Aik in the PDn(Ai, QSj), the probability of forwarding the query to Aik is determined in the following way in order to assign higher forwarding probability to the neighboring agents with higher expected utility value: πn+1 i (QSj, αik ) = dn+1 i |PDn(Ai, QSj)| + β ∗ ` Uik (QSj) − PDU(Ai, QSj) |PDn(Ai, QSj)| ´ (3) where PDUn(Ai, QSj) = X o∈P Dn(Ai,QSj ) Uo(QSj) and QSj is the subsequent state of agent Aik after agent Ai forwards the search session with state QSj to its neighboring agent Aik ; If QSj = (qk, ttl0), then QSj = (qk, ttl0 − 1) .
4-62:In formula 3, the first term on the right of the equation, dn+1 i |P Dn(Ai,QSj )| , is used to to determine the forwarding probability by equally distributing the forward width, dn+1 i , to the agents in PDn(Ai, QSj) set .
4-63:The second term is used to adjust the probability of being chosen so that agents with higher expected utility values will be favored .
4-64:β is determined according to: β = min ` m − dn+1 i m ∗ umax − PDUn(Ai, QSj) , dn+1 i PDUn(Ai, QSj) − m ∗ umin ´ (4) where m = |PDn(Ai, QSj)|, umax = max o∈P Dn(Ao,QSj ) Uo(QSj) and umin = min o∈P Dn(Ao,QSj ) Uo(QSj) This formula guarantees that the final πn+1 i (QSj, αik ) value is well defined, i.e, 0 ≤ πn+1 i (QSj, αik ) ≤ 1 and X i πn+1 i (QSj, αik ) = dn+1 i However, such a solution does not explore all the possibilities .
4-65:In order to balance between exploitation and exploration, a λ Greedy approach is taken .
4-66:In the λ Greedy approach, in addition to assigning higher probability to those agents with higher expected utility value, as in the equation (3) .
4-67:Agents that appear to be not so good choices will also be sent queries based on a dynamic exploration rate .
4-68:In particular, for agents in the set PDn(Ai, QSj), πn+1 i1 (QSj) is determined in the same way as the above, with the only difference being that dn+1 i is replaced with dn+1 i ∗ (1 − λn) .
4-69:The remaining search bandwidth is used for learning by assigning probability λn evenly to agents Ai2 in the set DirectConn(Ai) − PDn(Ai, QSj) .
4-70:πn+1 i2 (QSj, αik ) = dn+1 i ∗ λn |DirectConn(Ai) − PDn(Ai, QSj)| (5) where PDn(Ai, QSj) ⊂ DirectConn(Ai) .
4-71:Note that the exploration rate λ is not a constant and it decreases overtime .
4-72:The λ is determined according to the following equation: λn+1 = λ0 ∗ e−c1n (6) where λ0 is the initial exploration rate, which is a constant; c1 is also a constant to adjust the decreasing rate of the exploration rate; n is the current time unit .
4-73:3.1.2 Update Expected Utility Once the routing policy at step n+1, πn+1 i , is determined based on the above formula, agent Ai can update its own expected utility, Un+1 i (QSi), based on the the updated routing policy resulted from the formula 5 and the updated U values of its neighboring agents .
4-74:Under the assumption that after a query is forwarded to Ai"s neighbors the subsequent search sessions are independent, the update formula is similar to the Bellman update formula in Q Learning: Un+1 i (QSj) = (1 − θi) ∗ Un i (QSj) + θi ∗ (Rn+1 i (QSj) + X k πn+1 i (QSj, αik )Un k (QSj)) (7) where QSj = (Qj, ttl − 1) is the next state of QSj = (Qj, ttl); Rn+1 i (QSj) is the expected local reward for query class Qk at agent Ai under the routing policy πn+1 i ; θi is the coefficient for deciding how much weight is given to the old value during the update process: the smaller θi value is, the faster the agent is expected to learn the real value, while the greater volatility of the algorithm, and vice versa .
4-75:Rn+1 (s) is updated according to the following equation: 234 The Sixth Intl .
4-76:Joint Conf .
4-77:on Autonomous Agents and Multi Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) Rn+1 i (QSj) = Rn i (QSj) +γi ∗ (r(QSj) − Rn i (QSj)) ∗ P(qj|Qj ) (8) where r(QSj) is the local reward associated with the search session .
4-78:P(qj|Qj ) indicates how relevant the query qj is to the query type Qj, and γi is the learning rate for agent Ai .
4-79:Depending on the similarity between a specific query qi and its corresponding query type Qi, the local reward associated with the search session has different impact on the Rn i (QSj) estimation .
4-80:In the above formula, this impact is reflected by the coefficient, the P(qj|Qj) value .
4-81:3.1.3 Reward function After a search session stops when its TTL values expires, all search results are returned back to the user and are compared against the relevance judgment .
4-82:Assuming the set of search results is SR, the reward Rew(SR) is defined as: Rew(SR) = j 1 if |Rel(SR)| > c |Rel(SR)| c otherwise .
4-83:where SR is the set of returned search results, Rel(SR) is the set of relevant documents in the search results .
4-84:This equation specifies that users give 1.0 reward if the number of returned relevant documents reaches a predefined number relevant documents returned .
4-85:This rationale for setting up such a cut off value is that the importance of recall ratio decreases with the abundance of relevant documents in real world, therefore users tend to focus on only a limited number of searched results .
4-86:The details of the actual routing protocol will be introduced in Section 3.2 when we introduce how the learning algorithm is deployed in real systems .
4-87:3.2 Deployment of the Learning algorithm This section describes how the learning algorithm can be used in either a single phase or a two phase search process .
4-88:In the single phase search algorithm, search sessions start from the initiators of the queries .
4-89:In contrast, in the two step search algorithm, the query initiator first attempts to seek a more appropriate starting point for the query by introducing an exploratory step as described in Section 2 .
4-90:Despite the difference in the quality of starting points, the major part of the learning process for the two algorithms is largely the same as described in the following paragraphs .
4-91:Before learning starts, each agent initializes the expected utility value for all possible states as 0 .
4-92:Thereafter, upon receipt of a query, in addition to the normal operations described in the previous section, an agent Ai also sets up a timer to wait for the search results returned from its downstream agents .
4-93:Once the timer expires or it has received response from all its downstream agents, Ai merges and forwards the search results accrued from its downstream agents to its upstream agent .
4-94:Setting up the timer speeds up the learning because agents can avoid waiting too long for the downstream agents to return search results .
4-95:Note that these detailed results and corresponding agent information will still be stored at Ai until the feedback information is passed from its upstream agent and the performance of its downstream agents can be evaluated .
4-96:The duration of the timer is related to the TTL value .
4-97:In this paper, we set the timer to ttimer = ttli ∗ 2 + tf , where ttli ∗ 2 is the sum of the travel time of the queries in the network, and tf is the expected time period that users would like to wait .
4-98:The search results will eventually be returned to the search session initiator A0 .
4-99:They will be compared to the relevance judgment that is provided by the final users (as described in the experiment section, the relevance judgement for the query set is provided along with the data collections) .
4-100:The reward will be calculated and propagated backward to the agents along the way that search results were passed .
4-101:This is a reverse process of the search results propagation .
4-102:In the process of propagating reward backward, agents update estimates of their own potential utility value, generate an upto dated policy and pass their updated results to the neighboring agents based on the algorithm described in Section 3 .
4-103:Upon change of expected utility value, agent Ai sends out its updated utility estimation to its neighbors so that they can act upon the changed expected utility and corresponding state .
4-104:This update message includes the potential reward as well as the corresponding state QSi = (qk, ttll) of agent Ai .
4-105:Each neighboring agent, Aj, reacts to this kind of update message by updating the expected utility value for state QSj(qk, ttll + 1) according to the newly announced changed expected utility value .
4-106:Once they complete the update, the agents would again in turn inform related neighbors to update their values .
4-107:This process goes on until the TTL value in the update message increases to the TTL limit .
4-108:To speed up the learning process, while updating the expected utility values of an agent Ai"s neighboring agents we specify that Um(Qk, ttl0) >= Um(Qk, ttl1) iff ttl0 > ttl1 Thus, when agent Ai receives an updated expected utility value with ttl1, it also updates the expected utility values with any ttl0 > ttl1 if Um(Qk, ttl0) < Um(Qk, ttl1) to speed up convergence .
4-109:This heuristic is based on the fact that the utility of a search session is a non decreasing function of time t .
4-110:3.3 Discussion In formalizing the content routing system as a learning task, many assumptions are made .
4-111:In real systems, these assumptions may not hold, and thus the learning algorithm may not converge .
4-112:Two problems are of particular note, (1) This content routing problem does not have Markov properties .
4-113:In contrast to IP level based packet routing, the routing decision of each agent for a particular search session sj depends on the routing history of sj .
4-114:Therefore, the assumption that all subsequent search sessions are independent does not hold in reality .
4-115:This may lead to double counting problem that the relevant documents of some agents will be counted more than once for the state where the TTL value is more than 1 .
4-116:However, in the context of the hierarchical agent organizations, two factors mitigate this problems: first, the agents in each content group form a tree like structure .
4-117:With the absense of the cycles, the estimates inside the tree would be close to the accurate value .
4-118:Secondly, the stochastic nature of the routing policy partly remedies this problem .
4-119:The Sixth Intl .
4-120:Joint Conf .
4-121:on Autonomous Agents and Multi Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 235 (2) Another challenge for this learning algorithm is that in a real network environment observations on neighboring agents may not be able to be updated in time due to the communication delay or other situations .
4-122:In addition, when neighboring agents update their estimates at the same time, oscillation may arise during the learning process[1] .
4-123:This paper explores several approaches to speed up the learning process .
4-124:Besides the aforementioned strategy of updating the expected utility values, we also employ an active update strategy where agents notify their neighbors whenever its expected utility is updated .
4-125:Thus a faster convergence speed can be achieved .
4-126:This strategy contrasts to the Lazy update, where agents only echo their neighboring agents with their expected utility change when they exchange information .
4-127:The trade off between the two approaches is the network load versus learning speed .
4-128:The advantage of this learning algorithm is that once a routing policy is learned, agents do not have to repeatedly compare the similarity of queries as long as the network topology remains unchanged .
4-129:Instead, agent just have to determine the classification of the query properly and follow the learned policies .
4-130:The disadvantage of this learning based approach is that the learning process needs to be conducted whenever the network structure changes .
4-131:There are many potential extensions for this learning model .
4-132:For example, a single measure is currently used to indicate the traffic load for an agent"s neighborhood .
4-133:A simple extension would be to keep track of individual load for each neighbor of the agent. .
5 EXPERIMENTSSETTINGSAND RESULTS :
5-1:The experiments are conducted on TRANO simulation toolkit with two sets of datasets, TREC VLC 921 and TREC123 100 .
5-2:The following sub sections introduce the TRANO testbed, the datasets, and the experimental results .
5-3:4.1 TRANO Testbed TRANO (Task Routing on Agent Network Organization) is a multi agent based network based information retrieval testbed .
5-4:TRANO is built on top of the Farm [4], a time based distributed simulator that provides a data dissemination framework for large scale distributed agent network based organizations .
5-5:TRANO supports importation and exportation of agent organization profiles including topological connections and other features .
5-6:Each TRANO agent is composed of an agent view structure and a control unit .
5-7:In simulation, each agent is pulsed regularly and the agent checks the incoming message queues, performs local operations and then forwards messages to other agents .
5-8:4.2 Experimental Settings In our experiment, we use two standard datasets, TRECVLC 921 and TREC 123 100 datasets, to simulate the collections hosted on agents .
5-9:The TREC VLC 921 and TREC123 100 datasets were created by the U.S .
5-10:National Institute for Standard Technology(NIST) for its TREC conferences .
5-11:In distributed information retrieval domain, the two data collections are split to 921 and 100 sub collections .
5-12:It is observed that dataset TREC VLC 921 is more heterogeneous than TREC 123 100 in terms of source, document length, and relevant document distribution from the statistics of the two data collections listed in [13] .
5-13:Hence, TREC VLC 921 is much closer to real document distributions in P2P environments .
5-14:Furthermore, TREC 123 100 is split into two sets of 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 ARSS Query number ARSS versus the number of incoming queries for TREC VLC 921 SSLA 921 SSNA 921 Figure 3: ARSS(Average reward per search session) versus the number of search sessions for 1phase search in TREC VLC 921 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 ARSS Query number ARSS versus query number for TREC VLC 921 TSLA 921 TSNA 921 Figure 4: ARSS(Average reward per search session) versus the number of search sessions for 2phase search in TREC VLC 921 sub collections in two ways: randomly and by source .
5-15:The two partitions are denoted as TREC 123 100 Random and TREC 123 100 Source respectively .
5-16:The documents in each subcollection in dataset TREC 123 100 Source are more coherent than those in TREC 123 100 Random .
5-17:The two different sets of partitions allow us to observe how the distributed learning algorithm is affected by the homogeneity of the collections .
5-18:The hierarchical agent organization is generated by the algorithm described in our previous algorithm [15] .
5-19:During the topology generation process, degree information of each agent is estimated by the algorithm introduced by Palmer et al .
5-20:[9] with parameters α = 0.5 and β = 0.6 .
5-21:In our experiments, we estimate the upward limit and downward degree limit using linear discount factors 0.5, 0.8 and 1.0 .
5-22:Once the topology is built, queries randomly selected from the query set 301−350 on TREC VLC 921 and query set 1− 50 on TREC 123 100 Random and TREC 123 100 Source are injected to the system based on a Poisson distribution P(N(t) = n) = (λt)n n! e−λ 236 The Sixth Intl .

5-25:In our experiments, λ is set as 0.0543 so that the mean of the incoming queries from the environment to the agent network is 50 per time unit .
5-26:The service time for the communication queue and local search queue, i.e tQij and trs, is set as 0.01 time unit and 0.05 time units respectively .
5-27:In our experiments, there are ten types of queries acquired by clustering the query set 301 − 350 and 1 − 50 .
5-28:4.3 Results analysis and evaluation Figure 3 demonstrates the ARSS(Average Reward per Search Session) versus the number of incoming queries over time for the the Single Step based Non learning Algorithm (SSNA), and the Single Step Learning Algorithm(SSLA) for data collection TREC VLC 921 .
5-29:It shows that the average reward for SSNA algorithm ranges from 0.02 − 0.06 and the performance changes little over time .
5-30:The average reward for SSLA approach starts at the same level with the SSNA algorithm .
5-31:But the performance increases over time and the average performance gain stabilizes at about 25% after query range 2000 − 3000 .
5-32:Figure 4 shows the ARSS(Average Reward per Search Session) versus the number of incoming queries over time for the the Two Step based Non learning Algorithm(TSNA), and the Two Step Learning Algorithm(TSLA) for data collection TREC VLC 921 .
5-33:The TSNA approach has a relatively consistent performance with the average reward ranges from 0.05 − 0.15 .
5-34:The average reward for TSLA approach, where learning algorithm is exploited, starts at the same level with the TSNA algorithm and improves the average reward over time until 2000−2500 queries joining the system .
5-35:The results show that the average performance gain for TSLA approach over TNLA approach is 35% after stabilization .
5-36:Figure 5 shows the cumulative utility versus the number of incoming queries over time for SSNA, SSLA,TSNA, and TSLA respectively .
5-37:It illustrates that the cumulative utility of non learning algorithms increases largely linearly over time, while the gains of learning based algorithms accelerate when more queries enter the system .
5-38:These experimental results demonstrate that learning based approaches consistently perform better than non learning based routing algorithm .
5-39:Moreover, two phase learning based algorithm is better than single phase based learning algorithm because the maximal reward an agent can receive from searching its neighborhood within TTL hops is related to the total number of the relevant documents in that area .
5-40:Thus, even the optimal routing policy can do little beyond reaching these relevant documents faster .
5-41:On the contrary, the two stepbased learning algorithm can relocate the search session to a neighborhood with more relevant documents .
5-42:The TSLA combines the merits of both approaches and outperforms them .
5-43:Table 1 lists the cumulative utility for datasets TREC123 100 Random and TREC 123 100 Source with hierarchical organizations .
5-44:The five columns show the results for four different approaches .
5-45:In particular, column TSNA Random shows the results for dataset TREC 123 100 Random with the TSNA approach .
5-46:The column TSLA Random shows the results for dataset TREC 123 100 Random with the TSLA approach .
5-47:There are two numbers in each cell in the column TSLA Random .
5-48:The first number is the actual cumulative utility while the second number is the percentage gain in terms of the utility over TSNA approach .
5-49:Columns TSNA Source and TSLA Source show the results for dataset TREC 123 100 Source with TSNA and TSLA approaches respectively .
5-50:Table 1 shows that the performance improvement for TREC 123 100 Random is not as significant as the other datasets .
5-51:This is because that the documents in the sub collection of TREC 123 100 Random are selected randomly which makes the collection model, the signature of the collection, less meaningful .
5-52:Since both algorithms are designed based on the assumption that document collections can be well represented by their collection model, this result is not surprising .
5-53:Overall, Figures 4, 5, and Table 1 demonstrate that the reinforcement learning based approach can considerably enhance the system performance for both data collections .
5-54:However, it remains as future work to discover the correlation between the magnitude of the performance gains and the size of the data collection and or the extent of the heterogeneity between the sub collections. .

6-1:The content routing problem differs from the networklevel routing in packet switched communication networks in that content based routing occurs in application level networks .
6-2:In addition, the destination agents in our contentrouting algorithms are multiple and the addresses are not known in the routing process .
6-3:IP level Routing problems have been attacked from the reinforcement learning perspective[2, 5, 11, 12] .
6-4:These studies have explored fully distributed algorithms that are able, without central coordination to disseminate knowledge about the network, to find the shortest paths robustly and efficiently in the face of changing network topologies and changing link costs .
6-5:There are two major classes of adaptive, distributed packet routing algorithms in the literature: distance vector algorithms and link state algorithms .
6-6:While this line of studies carry a certain similarity with our work, it has mainly focused on packet switched communication networks .

6-12:It has been discovered that the locality property is an important feature of information retrieval systems in user modeling studies[3] .
6-13:In P2P based content sharing systems, this property is exemplified by the phenomenon that users tend to send queries that represent only a limited number of topics and conversely, users in the same neighborhood are likely to share common interests and send similar queries [10] .
6-14:The learning based approach is perceived to be more beneficial for real distributed information retrieval systems which exhibit locality property .
6-15:This is because the users" traffic and query patterns can reduce the state space and speed up the learning process .
6-16:Related work in taking advantage of this property include [7], where the authors attempted to address this problem by user modeling techniques. .
7 ABSTRACT :
7-1:In this paper, a reinforcement learning based approach is developed to improve the performance of distributed IR search algorithms
7-2:Particularly, agents maintain estimates, namely expected utility, on the downstream agents" ability to provide relevant documents for incoming queries
7-3:These estimates are updated gradually by learning from the feedback information returned from previous search sessions
7-4:Based on the updated expected utility information, the agents modify their routing policies
7-5:Thereafter, these agents route the queries based on the learned policies and update the estimates on the expected utility based on the new routing policies
7-6:The experiments on two different distributed IR datasets illustrates that the reinforcement learning approach improves considerably the cumulative utility over time.
