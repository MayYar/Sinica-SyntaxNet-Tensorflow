We have presented here and experimented a protocol for MAS online concept learning
The main feature of this collaborative learning mechanism is that it maintains a consistency property
The hypotheses of our experiments do not address the issues of distributed MAS such as faults (for instance messages could be lost or corrupted) or other failures in general (crash, byzantine faults, etc.)
Nevertheless, our framework is open, i.e., the agents can leave the system or enter it while the consistency mechanism is preserved
For instance if we introduce a timeout mechanism, even when a critic agent crashes or omits to answer, the consistency with the other critics (within the remaining agents) is entailed
In [1], a similar approach has been applied to MAS abduction problems
Further work concerns first coupling induction and abduction in order to perform collaborative concept learning when examples are only partially observed by each agent, and second, investigating partial memory learning
Aknowledgments We are very grateful to Dominique Bouthinon for implementing late modifications in SMILE, so much easing our experiments
Part of this work has been performed during the first author"s visit to the Atelier De BioInformatique of Paris VI university, France.
