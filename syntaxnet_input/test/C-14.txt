2 INTRODUCTION :
2-1:Recent advances in computing hardware and software are responsible for the emergence of sensor networks capable of observing the environment, processing the data and making decisions based on the observations .
2-2:Such a network can be used to monitor the environment, detect, classify and locate specific events, and track targets over a specific region .
2-3:Examples of such systems are in surveillance, monitoring of pollution, traffic, agriculture or civil infrastructures [6] .
2-4:The deployment of sensor networks varies with the application considered .
2-5:It can be predetermined when the environment is sufficiently known and under control, in which case the sensors can be strategically hand placed .
2-6:The deployment can also be a priori undetermined when the environment is unknown or hostile in which case the sensors may be airdropped from an aircraft or deployed by other means, generally resulting in a random placement .
2-7:This paper investigates deployment strategies for sensor networks performing target detection over a region of interest .
2-8:In order to detect a target moving through the region, sensors have to make local observations of the environment and collaborate to produce a global decision that reflects the status of the region covered [2] .
2-9:This collaboration requires local processing of the observations, communication between different nodes, and information fusion [7] .
2-10:Since the local observations made by the sensors depend on their position, the performance of the detection algorithm is a function of the deployment .
2-11:One possible measure of the goodness of deployment for target detection is called path exposure .
2-12:It is a measure of the likelihood of detecting a target traversing the region using a given path .
2-13:The higher the path exposure, the better the deployment .
2-14:The set of paths to be considered may be constrained by the environment .
2-15:For example, if the target is expected to be following a road, only the paths consisting of the roads need to be considered .
2-16:In this study, the deployment is assumed to be random which corresponds to many practical applications where the region to be monitored is not accessible for precise placement of sensors .
2-17:The focus of this paper is to determine the number of sensors to be deployed to carry out target detection in a region of interest .
2-18:The tradeoffs lie between the network performance, the cost of the sensors deployed, and the cost of deploying the sensors .
2-19:This paper is organized as follows .
2-20:In section 2, a definition for path exposure is proposed and a method to evaluate the exposure of a given path is developed .
2-21:In section 3, the problem of random deployment is formulated and several solutions are presented .
2-22:An analytical study of these solutions is given in section 4 and section 5 presents simulation results that are used in section 6 to determine the optimum solution for a given environment .
2-23:The paper concludes with section 7. .
3 PATH EXPOSURE :
3-1:In this section, a model for sensor network target detection is proposed, a definition of path exposure is presented and expressions for evaluating this path exposure are developed .
3-2:2.1 Model Consider a rectangular sensor field with n sensors de42 ployed at locations si, i = 1, .
3-3:.
3-4:.
3-5:, n .
3-6:A target at location u emits a signal which is measured by the sensors .
3-7:The signal from the target decays as a polynomial of the distance .
3-8:If the decay coefficient is k, the signal energy of a target at location u measured by the sensor at si is given by Si(u) = K ||u − si||k (1) where K is the energy emitted by the target and ||u − si|| is the geometric distance between the target and the sensor .
3-9:Depending on the environment the value k typically ranges from 2.0 to 5.0 [4] .
3-10:Energy measurements at a sensor are usually corrupted by noise .
3-11:If Ni denotes the noise energy at sensor i during a particular measurement, then the total energy measured at sensor i, when the target is at location u, is Ei(u) = Si(u) + Ni = K ||u − si||k + Ni .
3-12:The sensors collaborate to arrive at a consensus decision as to whether a target is present in the region .
3-13:We consider two basic approaches for reaching this consensus: Value fusion and Decision fusion [3] .
3-14:In value fusion, one of the sensors gathers the energy measurements from the other sensors, totals up the energy and compares the sum to a threshold to decide whether a target is present .
3-15:If the sum exceeds the threshold, then the consensus decision is that a target is present .
3-16:In contrast, in decision fusion, each individual sensor compares its energy measurement to a threshold to arrive at a local decision as to whether a target is present .
3-17:The local decisions (1 for target present and 0 otherwise) from the sensors are totaled at a sensor and the sum is compared to another threshold to arrive at the consensus decision .
3-18:In some situations, value fusion outperforms decision fusion and vice versa .
3-19:2.1.1 Value Fusion .
3-20:The probability of consensus target detection when the target is at location u is Dv(u) = Prob n i=1 K ||u − si||k + Ni ≥ η = Prob n i=1 Ni ≥ η − n i=1 K ||u − si||k , where η is the value fusion threshold .
3-21:If the noise processes at the sensors are independent, then the probability density function of n i=1 Ni equals the convolution of the probability density function of Ni, i = 1, .
3-22:.
3-23:.
3-24:, n .
3-25:In particular, if the noise process at each sensor is Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), then n i=1 Ni has a Chi square distribution of degree n .
3-26:Due to the presence of noise, the sensors may incorrectly decide that a target is present even though there is no target in the field .
3-27:The probability of a consensus false target detection is Fv = Prob n i=1 Ni ≥ η .
3-28:(2) As above, if the noise processes at the sensors are independent and AWGN, then the false alarm probability can be computed from the Chi square distribution of degree n .
3-29:2.1.2 Decision Fusion .
3-30:For decision fusion, the probability of consensus target detection when the target is located at u is Dd(u) = Prob n i=1 hd,i(u) ≥ η2 = n j=η2 n j · P1 j · P0 (n−j) where P1 = Prob [hd,i(u) = 1] = Prob Ni ≥ η1 − K ||u − si||k and P0 = Prob [hd,i(u) = 0] = 1 − Prob [hd,i(u) = 1] .
3-31:can be computed from Chi square distribution of degree 1 for AWGN noise process .
3-32:The probability of false target detection at sensor i is Prob[gd,i = 1] = Prob[Ni ≥ η1] and Prob[gd,i = 0] = 1 − Prob[gd,i = 1] .
3-33:Therefore, the probability of consensus false target detection is Fd = Prob n i=1 gd,i ≥ η2 = n j=η2 n j · (Prob [gd,i = 1])j · (Prob [gd,i = 0])(n−j) The above equations serve as an analytic basis for evaluating exposure as defined in the following subsection .
3-34:Note that in value and decision fusion the knowledge of the sensors location can be used to make the detection decision .
3-35:For example, a sensor can report values that differ substantially from its neighbors values .
3-36:This discrepancy can be analyzed to avoid false alarms or misses and therefore improve the detection performance .
3-37:However, such algorithms are not considered in this paper .
3-38:2.2 De£nition of exposure We define exposure to be the probability of detecting the target or an intruder carrying out the unauthorized activity, where the activity depends on the problem under consideration .
3-39:In this paper, the activity considered is the Unauthorized Traversal as defined below .
3-40:Unauthorized Traversal Problem: We are given a sensor field with n sensors at locations s1, s2, .
3-41:.
3-42:.
3-43:, sn (see Figure 1) .
3-44:We are also given the stochastic characterization of the noise at each sensor and a tolerable bound, α, on the false alarm probability .
3-45:Let P denote a path from the west to the east periphery of the sensor field .
3-46:A target traversing the sensor field using path P is detected if it is detected at some point u ∈ P .
3-47:The exposure of path P is the net probability of detecting a target that traverses the field using P .
3-48:The target is assumed to be able to follow any path through the field and the problem is to find the path P with the least exposure .
3-49:43 Sensor Figure 1: Example sensor fields for UT problem .
3-50:2.3 Solution to the UT problem Let P denote a path from the west to the east periphery through the sensor field .
3-51:A target that traverses the field using P is not detected if and only if it is not detected at any time while it is on that path .
3-52:Since detection attempts by the sensor network occur at a fixed frequency, we can associate each detection attempt with a point u ∈ P when assuming that the target traverses the field at a constant speed .
3-53:The detection attempts are based on energy measured over a period of time T during which the target is moving .
3-54:Therefore, the detection probability associated with each point u reflects the measurements performed during time T .
3-55:Considering the path, the net probability of not detecting a target traversing the field using P is the product of the probabilities of no detection at each point u ∈ P .
3-56:That is, if G(P) denotes the net probability of not detecting a target as it traverses over path P, then, log G(P) = u∈P log(1 − D(u))du, where D(u) is either Dv(u) of Dd(u) depending on whether the sensors use value or decision fusion to arrive at a consensus decision .
3-57:Since the exposure of P is (1 − G(P)), the problem is to find the path which minimizes (1 − G(P)) or equivalently the path that minimizes | log G(P)|1 .
3-58:In general, the path P that minimizes | log G(P)| can be fairly arbitrary in shape .
3-59:The proposed solution does not exactly compute this path .
3-60:Instead, we rely on the following approximation .
3-61:We first divide the sensor field into a fine grid and then assume that the target only moves along this grid .
3-62:The problem then is to find the path P on this grid that minimizes | log G(P)| .
3-63:Note that, the finer the grid the closer the approximation .
3-64:Also, one can use higher order grids such as in [5] instead of the rectangular grid we use in this paper .
3-65:The higher order grids change the runtime of the algorithm but the approach is the same as with the rectangular grid .
3-66:For the target not to be detected at any point u ∈ P, 1 Note that, G(P) lies between 0 and 1 and thus log G(P) is negative. .

6-5:Figure 2: Pseudo code of the proposed solution for the UT problem .
6-6:it need not be detected at any point u lying between any two adjacent grid points of P .
6-7:We therefore subdivide any path P as a chain of grid segments .
6-8:Let us consider two adjacent points, say v1 and v2 on the grid .
6-9:Let l denote the line segment between v1 and v2 .
6-10:Also, let ml denote the probability of not detecting a target traveling between v1 and v2 on the line segment l .
6-11:Then, from the discussion above, log ml = u∈l log(1 − D(u))du (3) The probability ml can be evaluated by finding the detection probability D(u) at each point u ∈ l .
6-12:Note that, ml lies between 0 and 1 and, therefore, log ml is negative .
6-13:To find the least exposed path, a non negative weight equal to | log ml| is assigned to each segment l on this grid .
6-14:Also, a fictitious point a is created and a line segment is added from a to each grid point on the west periphery of the sensor field .
6-15:A weight equal to 0 is assigned to each of these line segments .
6-16:Similarly, a fictitious point b is created and a line segment is added from b to each grid point on the east periphery of the sensor field .
6-17:A weight equal to 0 is assigned to each of these line segments .
6-18:The problem of finding the least exposed path from west periphery to east periphery is then equivalent to the problem of finding the least weight path from a to b on this grid .
6-19:Such a path can be efficiently determined using the Dijkstra"s shortest path algorithm [1] .
6-20:A pseudo code of the overall algorithm is shown in Figure 2 .
6-21:Example: Figure 3 shows a sensor field with eight sensors at locations marked by dark circles .
6-22:Assume the noise process at each sensor is Additive White Gaussian with mean 0 and variance 1 .
6-23:Further assume that the sensors use value fusion to arrive at a consensus decision .
6-24:Then, from Equation 2, we chose a threshold η = 3.0 to achieve a false alarm probability of 0.187% .
6-25:The field has been divided into a 10 × 10 grid .
6-26:The target emits an energy K = 12 and the energy decay factor is 2 .
6-27:The figure shows the weight assigned to each line segment in the grid as described above .
6-28:The least exposure path found by the Dijkstra"s algorithm for this weighted grid is highlighted .

7 DEPLOYMENT :
7-1:In this section, the problem of sensor deployment for unauthorized traversal detection is formulated and solutions are identified .
7-2:3.1 Problem formulation Consider a region to be monitored for unauthorized traversal using a sensor network .
7-3:The target to traverse the sensor field emits a given energy level K and the stochastic of the noise in the region is known .
7-4:The sensors are to be deployed over the region in a random fashion where the sensors locations in the region are a priori undetermined and only the number or density of sensors can be chosen .
7-5:The problem is to find a deployment strategy that results in a desired performance level in unauthorized traversal monitoring of the region .
7-6:This performance is measured by the false alarm probability and the path exposure defined in section 2 .
7-7:The false alarm probability does not depend on the sensor placement and is only determined by the number of sensors deployed and the thresholds used in the detection algorithms .
7-8:It is assumed to be fixed in this study so that the problem consists of maximizing the exposure at constant false alarm rate .
7-9:Since targets can traverse the region through any path, the goal of deployment is to maximize the exposure of the least exposed path in the region .
7-10:Obviously, the minimum exposure in the region increases (if false alarm rate is kept constant) as more sensors are deployed in the region .
7-11:However, since the deployment is random, there are no guarantees that the desired exposure level is achieved for a given number of sensors .
7-12:Indeed some sensor placements can result in very poor detection ability, in particular when the sensors are all deployed in the same vicinity .
7-13:A study of the statistical distribution of exposure for varying sensor placement for a given number of sensors can provide a confidence level that the desired detection level is achieved .
7-14:In practical situations, only a limited number of sensors are available for deployment and only a limited detection level with associated confidence level is achievable at a given false alarm rate .
7-15:3.2 Solution Based on the above discussion, we develop a solution method to the deployment problem when a maximum of M sensors can be used .
7-16:Deploying the M sensors results in the maximum achievable detection level but is not optimal when considering the cost of sensors .
7-17:To reduce the number of sensors deployed, only part of the available sensors can be deployed first and the sensors can then report their position .
7-18:The random sensor placement obtained can be analyzed to determine if it satisfies the desired performance level .
7-19:If it does not, additional sensors can be deployed until the desired exposure level is reached or until the all M available sensors are deployed .
7-20:The number of sensors used in this strategy can be minimized by deploying one sensor at a time .
7-21:However, a cost is usually associated with each deployment of sensors and deploying one sensor at a time may not be cost effective if the cost of deployment is sufficiently large with respect to the cost of single sensors .
7-22:By assigning a cost to both single sensors and deployment, the optimal number of sensors to be deployed at first and thereafter can be determined .
7-23:In the next section, we develop analytical expressions for finding the optimal solution .
7-24:In general, the optimal cost solution is neither deploying one sensor at a time nor deploying all the sensors at a time. .
8 ANALYTICAL SOLUTION :
8-1:In this section, we derive an analytical model for the cost of deployment .
8-2:Let ed be the desired minimum exposure for the sensor network to be deployed when a maximum of M sensors are available for deployment .

8-4:ber of sensors n, the least exposure e is a random variable .
8-5:Let Fn(x) denote the cumulative distribution function of e, that is the probability that e is less than x, when n sensors are deployed .
8-6:As mentioned in the previous section, there is no a priori guarantee that the exposure ed will be obtained when deploying the sensors .
8-7:If M is the maximum number of sensors available, the confidence of obtaining a least exposure of ed or more is 1−FM (ed) .
8-8:For the proposed solution, we assume that the position of the sensors obtained after a deployment is known so that additional sensors can be deployed if the minimum exposure ed is not reached .
8-9:To evaluate the probability that the exposure ed is reached after additional sensor deployment, we make the following approximation: the distribution of exposure for n sensors is independent of the exposure corresponding to k of these n sensors, 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1 .
8-10:This is an approximation since the exposure obtained with n sensors is always higher than the exposure obtained with only k of these n sensors, 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1 .
8-11:We observed that the re deployment of just a few sensors can substantially modify the coverage of the region, for example when filling empty spaces .
8-12:The approximation is also justified by the loose relation between exposure and sensors positions .
8-13:Indeed, a given minimum exposure can correspond to many different deployment positions, some of which can be easily improved by deploying a few additional sensors (e.g .
8-14:when there is a empty space in the region coverage), some of which can only be improved by deploying many additional sensors (e.g .
8-15:when the sensors are evenly distributed on the region) .
8-16:As the minimum exposure e is a random variable, the cost of deploying the sensors in steps until the desired exposure is reached is also a random variable C .
8-17:We now derive the expression for the expected value of C .
8-18:Let ni be the total number of sensors deployed after each step i for a maximum number of steps S so that nS = M .
8-19:Note that ni − ni−1 is the number of sensors deployed at step i .
8-20:Also let Cd be the cost of deploying the sensors at each step and Cs be the cost of each sensor .
8-21:If the desired exposure is obtained after the first step, the cost of deployment is Cd + n1Cs, and this 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Number of sensors Probability ed =95% ed =90% ed =85% ed =80% Figure 5: Probability that the minimum exposure is above ed for varying number of sensors and ed=80%,85%,90% and 95% .
8-22:event happens with probability 1 − Fn1 (ed) .
8-23:Considering all the possible events, the expected cost is given by E{C} = S−1 i=1 (i.Cd + ni.Cs) i−1 j=1 Fnj (ed) (1 − Fni (ed)) + (S.Cd + M.Cs) S−1 j=1 Fnj (ed) (4) Note that a different expression is needed for the cost of step S since no additional sensors are deployed after this step even when the desired exposure is not obtained. .
9 SIMULATION :
9-1:In this section, we present results of simulations that were conducted to collect the exposure distribution function of the number of sensors deployed .
9-2:5.1 Method The exposure distribution is obtained by collecting statistics on the exposure when deploying sensors randomly in a predefined region .
9-3:The random deployment is assumed to be uniformly distributed over the region, which is a local approximation .
9-4:For every deployment, the minimum exposure is found using a simulator implementing the algorithm presented in section 2 .
9-5:A decay factor of k = 2 and maximum energy of K = 60 are chosen to model the energy emitted by targets (cf Equation 1) .
9-6:The region monitored is of size 20×20 with a noise of variance 1, so that the signal coming from the target is covered by noise when the target is 8 or more units length away from a sensor .
9-7:The sensors use value fusion to collaborate when making a common decision on the presence of a target in the region .
9-8:The threshold for detection is chosen as a function of the number of sensors to give a constant false alarm probability .
9-9:The false alarm probability for each detection attempt is chosen so that the probability to get one or more false alarm along a path of length 20 units (corresponding to 20 detection attempts by the sensors) is 5% .

9-11:5.2 Distribution of minimum exposure The distribution of minimum exposure were found for the number of sensor deployed varying from 1 to 40 .
9-12:To illustrate our results, the probability density functions for 5, 10 and 15 sensors are shown in Figure 4 .
9-13:We observe that for 5 sensors deployed, the minimum exposure has zero density for values less than the false alarm probability of .04 .
9-14:The highest density is obtained for values around .07 and then drops exponentially towards zero for higher values of exposure .
9-15:For deployment of 10 sensors, we find again that the minimum exposure has zero density for values below .04, then increases and has about constant density for values lying between .1 and .98 .
9-16:We also observe a peak of density around 1 .
9-17:For deployment of 15 sensors, densities start at zero for small values and remain very small for most values of minimum exposure .
9-18:The density slowly increases and has a large peak for minimum exposure of 1 .
9-19:As expected, the minimum exposure increases on average as the number of sensors deployed increases .
9-20:When randomly deploying 5 sensors, it is very unlikely to obtain a placement providing a desirable minimum exposure .
9-21:When deploying 10 sensors, most of the exposure levels are equally likely and only poor confidence is given to obtain a desirable exposure level .
9-22:When deploying 15 sensors, it is very likely that the sensor placement will give good exposure and this likelihood keeps increasing with the number of sensors deployed .
9-23:We use the cumulative distribution function obtained from the statistics collected to evaluate the likelihood that the desired level of exposure ed is obtained for varying number of sensors .
9-24:The graph of Figure 5 shows the probability that the minimum exposure is above ed as a function of the number of sensors deployed for ed = 80%, 85%, 90% and 95% .
9-25:These values can be used to evaluate the cost expressed in Equation 4 .
9-26:The graph shows that the confidence level to obtain a given minimum exposure level ed increases with the number of sensors deployed .
9-27:The confidence for ed when deploying 40 sensors is above .999, which is sufficient for most applications, and therefore we did not evaluate the distribution of exposure when deploying more than 40 sensors. .
10 RESULTS :
10-1:In this section, we evaluate the expected cost of deploying sensors using the simulation results .
10-2:The optimal number of sensor to deploy at first and in the succeeding steps can be derived from these results .
10-3:For this cost analysis, the region parameters and signal model are the same as specified in section 5 .
10-4:We further assume that the number of sensors deployed at every step is constant so that ni − ni−1 = n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ S .
10-5:In this case, Equation 4 reduces to E{C} = (Cd + n.Cs) S−1 i=1 i .
10-6:i−1 j=1 Fj.n(ed) (1 − Fi.n(ed)) + (S.Cd + M.Cs) S−1 j=1 Fj.n(ed) (5) We evaluated the expected cost as a function of n for three different cost assignments with a desired exposure of ed = 95% .
10-7:The three corresponding graphs are shown in Figure 6 .
10-8:The first cost assignment is (Cd = 0, Cs = 1) so that the expected cost is the expected number of sensors to be used to achieve an exposure of 95% .
10-9:Since Cd = 0, the number of steps used to deploy the sensors doesn"t affect the cost and it is therefore optimal to deploy one sensor at a time until the minimum exposure ed is reached, as we observe on the graph .
10-10:Overall, the expected number of sensor to be 47 deployed increases with n but we observe a local minimum for n = 16 that can be explained by the following analysis .
10-11:The expected number of sensors is a weighted sum of i.n, 1 ≤ i ≤ S that are the different number of sensors than can be deployed at a time when deploying n sensors at each step .
10-12:For n around 16, the probability that the minimum exposure is above ed varies a lot as shown in Figure 5 and the weight associated with the first term of the sum (n) increases rapidly while the weights associated with higher number of sensors decrease .
10-13:This is the cause of the local minimum and the cost starts to increase again when the increase in n compensates for the decrease in weights .
10-14:The second cost assignment is (Cd = 5, Cs = 1) so that the cost of a deployment is equal to the cost of five sensors (note that only the relative cost of Cd Cs determines the shape of the graphs) .
10-15:In this case, deploying one sensor at a time is prohibited by the cost of deployment and the optimal number of sensors to deploy at every step is 19 .
10-16:Again, we find that the curve presents a local minimum for n = 9 that is due to the variations in weights .
10-17:The last cost assignment is (Cd = 100, Cs = 1) and the minimum cost is achieved when deploying 27 sensors at every step .
10-18:These results are specific to the region and the parameters characterizing the signal emitted by the target that were chosen for the simulation .
10-19:Similar results can be derived for other parameters, most of the effort residing in finding the exposure distributions through simulation. .
11 CONCLUSION :
11-1:This paper addresses the problem of sensor deployment in a region to be monitored for target intrusion .
11-2:A mechanism for sensor collaboration to perform target detection is proposed and analyzed to evaluate the exposure of paths through the region .
11-3:The minimum exposure is used as a measure of the goodness of deployment, the goal being to maximize the exposure of the least exposed path in the region .
11-4:In the case where sensors are randomly placed in a region to be monitored, a mechanism for sequential deployment in steps is developed .
11-5:The strategy consists of deploying a limited number of sensors at a time until the desired minimum exposure is achieved .
11-6:The cost function used in this study depends on the number of sensors deployed in each step and the cost of each deployment .
11-7:Through simulation, the distribution of minimum exposure obtained by random deployment was evaluated for varying number of sensors deployed .
11-8:These results were used to evaluate the cost of deployment for varying number of sensors deployed in each step .
11-9:We found that the optimal number of sensors deployed in each step varies with the relative cost assigned to deployment and sensors .
11-10:The results of this study can be extended to larger regions with different target parameters .
11-11:The solution proposed in this paper can also be improved by considering deploying variable number of sensors at each step and this multiple variables problem requires further investigation. .
