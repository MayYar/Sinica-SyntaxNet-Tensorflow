Strong Equilibrium in Cost Sharing Connection Games 
content:
1 ABSTRACT :
1-1:In this work we study cost sharing connection games, where each player has a source and sink he would like to connect, and the cost of the edges is either shared equally (fair connection games) or in an arbitrary way (general connection games) .
1-2:We study the graph topologies that guarantee the existence of a strong equilibrium (where no coalition can improve the cost of each of its members) regardless of the specific costs on the edges .
1-3:Our main existence results are the following: (1) For a single source and sink we show that there is always a strong equilibrium (both for fair and general connection games) .
1-4:(2) For a single source multiple sinks we show that for a series parallel graph a strong equilibrium always exists (both for fair and general connection games) .
1-5:(3) For multi source and sink we show that an extension parallel graph always admits a strong equilibrium in fair connection games .
1-6:As for the quality of the strong equilibrium we show that in any fair connection games the cost of a strong equilibrium is Θ(log n) from the optimal solution, where n is the number of players .
1-7:(This should be contrasted with the Ω(n) price of anarchy for the same setting.) For single source general connection games and single source single sink fair connection games, we show that a strong equilibrium is always an optimal solution .

2 INTRODUCTION :
2-1:Computational game theory has introduced the issue of incentives to many of the classical combinatorial optimization problems .
2-2:The view that the demand side is many times not under the control of a central authority that optimizes the global performance, but rather under the control of individuals with different incentives, has led already to many important insights .
2-3:Consider classical routing and transportation problems such as multicast or multi commodity problems, which are many times viewed as follows .
2-4:We are given a graph with edge costs and connectivity demands between nodes, and our goal is to find a minimal cost solution .
2-5:The classical centralized approach assumes that all the individual demands can both be completely coordinated and have no individual incentives .
2-6:The game theory point of view would assume that each individual demand is controlled by a player that optimizes its own utility, and the resulting outcome could be far from the optimal solution .
2-7:When considering individual incentives one needs to discuss the appropriate solution concept .
2-8:Much of the research in computational game theory has focused on the classical Nash equilibrium as the primary solution concept .
2-9:Indeed Nash equilibrium has many benefits, and most importantly it always exists (in mixed strategies) .
2-10:However, the solution concept of Nash equilibrium is resilient only to unilateral deviations, while in reality, players may be able to coordinate their actions .
2-11:A strong equilibrium [4] is a state from which no coalition (of any size) can deviate and improve the utility of every member of the coalition (while possibly lowering the utility 84 of players outside the coalition) .
2-12:This resilience to deviations by coalitions of the players is highly attractive, and one can hope that once a strong equilibrium is reached it is highly likely to sustain .
2-13:From a computational game theory point of view, an additional benefit of a strong equilibrium is that it has a potential to reduce the distance between the optimal solution and the solution obtained as an outcome of selfish behavior .
2-14:The strong price of anarchy (SPoA), introduced in [1], is the ratio between the cost of the worst strong equilibrium and the cost of an optimal solution .
2-15:Obviously, SPoA is meaningful only in those cases where a strong equilibrium exists .
2-16:A major downside of strong equilibrium is that most games do not admit any strong equilibrium .
2-17:Even simple classical games like the prisoner"s dilemma do not posses any strong equilibrium (which is also an example of a congestion game that does not posses a strong equilibrium1 concentration in strong equilibrium, despite its highly attractive properties .
2-18:Yet, [1] have identified two broad families of games, namely job scheduling and network formation, where a strong equilibrium always exists and the SPoA is significantly lower than the price of anarchy (which is the ratio between the worst Nash equilibrium and the optimal solution [15, 18, 5, 6]) .
2-19:In this work we concentrate on cost sharing connection games, introduced by [3, 2] .
2-20:In such a game, there is an underlying directed graph with edge costs, and individual users have connectivity demands (between a source and a sink) .
2-21:We consider two models .
2-22:The fair cost connection model [2] allows each player to select a path from the source to the sink2 .
2-23:In this game the cost of an edge is shared equally between all the players that selected the edge, and the cost of the player is the sum of its costs on the edges it selected .
2-24:The general connection game [3] allows each player to offer prices for edges .
2-25:In this game an edge is bought if the sum of the offers at least covers its cost, and the cost of the player is the sum of its offers on the bought edges (in both games we assume that the player has to guarantee the connectivity between its source and sink) .
2-26:In this work we focus on two important issues .
2-27:The first one is identifying under what conditions the existence of a strong equilibrium is guaranteed, and the second one is the quality of the strong equilibria .
2-28:For the existence part, we identify families of graph topologies that possess some strong equilibrium for any assignment of edge costs .
2-29:One can view this separation between the graph topology and the edge costs, as a separation between the underlying infrastructure and the costs the players observe to purchase edges .
2-30:While one expects the infrastructure to be stable over long periods of time, the costs the players observe can be easily modified over short time periods .
2-31:Such a topological characterization of the underlying infrastructure provides a network designer topological conditions that will ensure stability in his network .
2-32:Our results are as follows .
2-33:For the single commodity case (all the players have the same source and sink), there is a strong equilibrium in any graph (both for fair and general connection games) .
2-34:Moreover, the strong equilibrium is also 1 while any congestion game is known to admit at least one Nash equilibrium in pure strategies [16] .
2-35:2 The fair cost sharing scheme is also attractive from a mechanism design point of view, as it is a strategyproof costsharing mechanism [14] .
2-36:the optimal solution (namely, the players share a shortest path from the common source to the common sink) .
2-37:For the case of a single source and multiple sinks (for example, in a multicast tree), we show that in a fair connection game there is a strong equilibrium if the underlying graph is a series parallel graph, and we show an example of a nonseries parallel graph that does not have a strong equilibrium .
2-38:For the case of multi commodity (multi sources and sinks), we show that in a fair connection game if the graph is an extension parallel graph then there is always a strong equilibrium, and we show an example of a series parallel graph that does not have a strong equilibrium .
2-39:As far as we know, we are the first to provide a topological characterization for equilibrium existence in multi commodity and single source network games .
2-40:For any fair connection game we show that if there exists a strong equilibrium it is at most a factor of Θ(log n) from the optimal solution, where n is the number of players .
2-41:This should be contrasted with the Θ(n) bound that exists for the price of anarchy [2] .
2-42:For single source general connection games, we show that any series parallel graph possesses a strong equilibrium, and we show an example of a graph that does not have a strong equilibrium .
2-43:In this case we also show that any strong equilibrium is optimal .
2-44:Related work Topological characterizations for single commodity network games have been recently provided for various equilibrium properties, including equilibrium existence [12, 7, 8], equilibrium uniqueness [10] and equilibrium efficiency [17, 11] .
2-45:The existence of pure Nash equilibrium in single commodity network congestion games with player specific costs or weights was studied in [12] .
2-46:The existence of strong equilibrium was studied in both utility decreasing (e.g., routing) and utility increasing (e.g., fair cost sharing) congestion games .
2-47:[7, 8] have provided a full topological characterization for a SE existence in single commodity utility decreasing congestion games, and showed that a SE always exists if and only if the underlying graph is extension parallel .
2-48:[19] have shown that in single commodity utility increasing congestion games, the topological characterization is essentially equivalent to parallel links .
2-49:In addition, they have shown that these results hold for correlated strong equilibria as well (in contrast to the decreasing setting, where correlated strong equilibria might not exist at all) .
2-50:While the fair cost sharing games we study are utility increasing network congestion games, we derive a different characterization than [19] due to the different assumptions regarding the players" actions.3 .

3-18:Note that S = (Si, S−i) .
3-19:The social cost of a game Λ is the sum of the costs of the players, and we denote by OPT(Λ) the minimal social cost of a game Λ .
3-20:i.e., OPT(Λ) = minS∈Σ costΛ(S), where costΛ(S) = i∈N ci(S) .
3-21:A joint action S ∈ Σ is a pure Nash equilibrium if no player i ∈ N can benefit from unilaterally deviating from his action to another action, i.e., ∀i ∈ N ∀Si ∈ Σi : ci(S−i, Si) ≥ ci(S) .
3-22:We denote by NE(Λ) the set of pure Nash equilibria in the game Λ .
3-23:Resilience to coalitions: A pure deviation of a set of players Γ ⊂ N (also called coalition) specifies an action for each player in the coalition, i.e., γ ∈ ×i∈ΓΣi .
3-24:A joint action S ∈ Σ is not resilient to a pure deviation of a coalition Γ if there is a pure joint action γ of Γ such that ci(S−Γ, γ) < ci(S) for every i ∈ Γ (i.e., the players in the coalition can deviate in such a way that each player in the coalition reduces its cost) .
3-25:A pure Nash equilibrium S ∈ Σ is a k strong equilibrium, if there is no coalition Γ of size at most k, such that S is not resilient to a pure deviation by Γ .
3-26:We denote by k SE(Λ) the set of k strong equilibria in the game Λ .
3-27:We denote by SE(Λ) the set of n strong equilibria, and call S ∈ SE(Λ) a strong equilibrium .
3-28:Next we define the Price of Anarchy [9], Price of Stability [2], and their extension to Strong Price of Anarchy and Strong Price of Stability .
3-29:of anarchy (k SPoA) for the game Λ .
3-30:The Price of Anarchy (PoA) is the ratio between the maximal cost of a pure Nash equilibrium (assuming one exists) and the social optimum, i.e., maxS∈NE(Λ) costΛ(S) OPT(Λ) .
3-31:Similarly, the Price of Stability (PoS) is the ratio between the minimal cost of a pure Nash equilibrium and the social optimum, i.e., minS∈NE(Λ) costΛ(S) OPT(Λ) .
3-32:The k Strong Price of Anarchy (k SPoA) is the ratio between the maximal cost of a k strong equilibrium (assuming one exists) and the social optimum, i.e., maxS∈k SE(Λ) costΛ(S) OPT(Λ) .
3-33:The SPoA is the n SPoA .
3-34:Similarly, the Strong Price of Stability (SPoS) is the ratio between the minimal cost of a pure strong equilibrium and the social optimum, i.e., minS∈SE(Λ) costΛ(S) OPT(Λ) .
3-35:Note that both k SPoA and SPoS are defined only if some strong equilibrium exists .
3-36:2.2 Cost Sharing Connection Games A cost sharing connection game has an underlying directed graph G = (V, E) where each edge e ∈ E has an associated cost ce ≥ 04 .
3-37:In a connection game each player i ∈ N has an associated source si and sink ti .
3-38:In a fair connection game the actions Σi of player i include all the paths from si to ti .
3-39:The cost of each edge is shared equally by the set of all players whose paths contain it .
3-40:Given a joint action, the cost of a player is the sum of his costs on the edges it selected .
3-41:More formally, the cost function of each player on an edge e, in a joint action S, is fe(ne(S)) = ce ne(S) , where ne(S) is the number of players that selected a path containing edge e in ci(S) = e∈Qi fe(ne(S)) .
3-42:4 In some of the existence proofs, we assume that ce > 0 for simplicity .
3-43:The full version contains the complete proofs for the case ce ≥ 0 .
3-44:In a general connection game the actions Σi of player i is a payment vector pi, where pi(e) is how much player i is offering to contribute to the cost of edge e.5 Given a profile p, any edge e such that i pi(e) ≥ ce is considered bought, and Ep denotes the set of bought edges .
3-45:Let Gp = (V, Ep) denote the graph bought by the players for profile p = (p1, .

3-48:, pn) .
3-49:Clearly, each player tries to minimize his total payment which is ci(p) = e∈Ep pi(e) if si is connected to ti in Gp, and infinity otherwise.6 We denote by c(p) = i ci(p) the total cost under the profile p .
3-50:For a subgraph H of G we denote the total cost of the edges in H by c(H) .
3-51:A symmetric connection game implies that the source and sink of all the players are identical .
3-52:(We also call a symmetric connection game a single source single sink connection game, or a single commodity connection game.) A single source connection game implies that the sources of all the players are identical .
3-53:Finally, A multi commodity connection game implies that each player has its own source and sink .
3-54:2.3 Extension Parallel and Series Parallel Directed Graphs Our directed graphs would be acyclic, and would have a source node (from which all nodes are reachable) and a sink node (which every node can reach) .
3-55:We first define the following actions for composition of directed graphs .
3-56:• Identification: The identification operation allows to collapse two nodes to one .
3-57:More formally, given graph G = (V, E) we define the identification of a node v1 ∈ V and v2 ∈ V forming a new node v ∈ V as creating a new graph G = (V , E ), where V = V −{v1, v2}∪{v} and E includes the edges of E where the edges of v1 and v2 are now connected to v .
3-58:• Parallel composition: Given two directed graphs, G1 = (V1, E1) and G2 = (V2, E2), with sources s1 ∈ V1 and s2 ∈ V2 and sinks t1 ∈ V1 and t2 ∈ V2, respectively, we define a new graph G = G1||G2 as follows .
3-59:Let G = (V1 ∪ V2, E1 ∪ E2) be the union graph .
3-60:To create G = G1||G2 we identify the sources s1 and s2, forming a new source node s, and identify the sinks t1 and t2, forming a new sink t .
3-61:• Series composition: Given two directed graphs, G1 = (V1, E1) and G2 = (V2, E2), with sources s1 ∈ V1 and s2 ∈ V2 and sinks t1 ∈ V1 and t2 ∈ V2, respectively, we define a new graph G = G1 → G2 as follows .
3-62:Let G = (V1 ∪ V2, E1 ∪ E2) be the union graph .
3-63:To create G = G1 → G2 we identify the vertices t1 and s2, forming a new vertex u .
3-64:The graph G has a source s = s1 and a sink t = t2 .
3-65:• Extension composition : A series composition when one of the graphs, G1 or G2, is composed of a single directed edge is an extension composition, and we denote it by G = G1 →e G2 .
3-66:An extension parallel graph is a graph G consisting of either: (1) a single directed edge (s, t), (2) a graph G = G1||G2 or (3) a graph G = G1 →e G2, where G1 and G2 are 5 We limit the players to select a path connecting si to ti and payment only on those edges .
3-67:6 This implies that in equilibrium every player has its sink and source connected by a path in Gp .
3-68:86 extension parallel graphs (and in the extension composition either G1 or G2 is a single edge.) .
3-69:A series parallel graph is a graph G consisting of either: (1) a single directed edge (s, t), (2) a graph G = G1||G2 or (3) a graph G = G1 → G2, where G1 and G2 are series parallel graphs .
3-70:Given a path Q and two vertices u, v on Q, we denote the subpath of Q from u to v by Qu,v .
3-71:The following lemma, whose proof appears in the full version, would be the main topological tool in the case of single source graph .
3-72:Lemma 2.1 .
3-73:Let G be an SPG with source s and sink t .
3-74:Given a path Q, from s to t, and a vertex t , there exist a vertex y ∈ Q, such that for any path Q from s to t , the path Q contains y and the paths Qy,t and Q are edge disjoint .
3-75:(We call the vertex y the intersecting vertex of Q and t .) .
4-1:This section derives our results for fair connection games
4-2:3.1 Existence of Strong Equilibrium While it is known that every fair connection game possesses a Nash equilibrium in pure strategies [2], this is not necessarily the case for a strong equilibrium
4-3:In this section, we study the existence of strong equilibrium in fair connection games
4-4:We begin with a simple case, showing that every symmetric fair connection game possesses a strong equilibrium
4-5:Theorem 3.1
4-6:In every symmetric fair connection game there exists a strong equilibrium
4-7:Proof
4-8:Let s be the source and t be the sink of all the players
4-9:We show that a profile S in which all the players choose the same shortest path Q (from the source s to the sink t ) is a strong equilibrium
4-10:Suppose by contradiction that S is not a SE
4-11:Then there is a coalition Γ that can deviate to a new profile S such that the cost of every player j ∈ Γ decreases
4-12:Let Qj be a new path used by player j ∈ Γ
4-13:Since Q is a shortest path, it holds that c(Qj \ (Q ∩ Qj)) ≥ c(Q \ (Q ∩ Qj)), for any path Qj
4-14:Therefore for every player j ∈ Γ we have that cj(S ) ≥ cj(S)
4-15:However, this contradicts the fact that all players in Γ reduce their cost
4-16:(In fact, no player in Γ has reduced its cost.) While every symmetric fair connection game admits a SE, it does not hold for every fair connection game
4-17:In what follows, we study the network topologies that admit a strong equilibrium for any assignment of edge costs, and give examples of topologies for which a strong equilibrium does not exist
4-18:The following lemma, whose proof appears in the full version, plays a major role in our proofs of the existence of SE
4-19:Lemma 3.2
4-20:Let Λ be a fair connection game on a series parallel graph G with source s and sink t
4-21:Assume that player i has si = s and ti = t and that Λ has some SE
4-22:Let S be a SE that minimizes the cost of player i (out of all SE), i.e., ci(S) = minT ∈SE(Λ) ci(T) and let S∗ be the profile that minimizes the cost of player i (out of all possible profiles), i.e., ci(S∗ ) = minT ∈Σ ci(T)
4-23:Then, ci(S) = ci(S∗ )
4-24:The next lemma considers parallel composition
4-25:Lemma 3.3
4-26:Let Λ be a fair connection game on graph G = G1||G2, where G1 and G2 are series parallel graphs
4-27:If every fair connection game on the graphs G1 and G2 possesses a strong equilibrium, then the game Λ possesses a strong equilibrium
4-28:Proof
4-29:Let G1 = (V1, E1) and G2 = (V2, E2) have sources s1 and s2 and sinks t1 and t2, respectively
4-30:Let Ti be the set of players with an endpoint in Vi \ {s, t}, for i ∈ {1, 2}
4-31:(An endpoint is either a source or a sink of a player)
4-32:Let T3 be the set of players j such that sj = s and tj = t
4-33:Let Λ1 and Λ2 be the original game on the respective graphs G1 and G2 with players T1 ∪ T3 and T2 ∪ T3, respectively
4-34:Let S and S be the SE in Λ1 and Λ2 that minimizes the cost of players in T3, respectively
4-35:Assume w.l.o.g
4-36:that ci(S ) ≤ ci(S ) where player i ∈ T3
4-37:In addition, let Λ2 be the game on the graph G2 with players T2 and let ¯S be a SE in Λ2
4-38:We will show that the profile S = S ∪ ¯S is a SE in Λ
4-39:Suppose by contradiction that S is not a SE
4-40:Then, there is a coalition Γ that can deviate such that the cost of every player j ∈ Γ decreases
4-41:By Lemma 3.2 and the assumption that ci(S ) ≤ ci(S ), a player j ∈ T3 cannot improve his cost
4-42:Therefore, Γ ⊆ T1 ∪ T2
4-43:But this is a contradiction to S being a SE in Λ1 or ¯S being a SE in Λ2
4-44:The following theorem considers the case of single source fair connection games
4-45:Theorem 3.4
4-46:Every single source fair connection game on a series parallel graph possesses a strong equilibrium
4-47:Proof
4-48:We prove the theorem by induction on the network size |V |
4-49:The claim obviously holds if |V | = 2
4-50:We show the claim for a series composition, i.e., G = G1 → G2, and for a parallel composition, i.e., G = G1||G2, where G1 = (V1, E1) and G2 = (V2, E2) are SPG"s with sources s1, s2, and sinks t1, t2, respectively
4-51:series composition
4-52:Let G = G1 → G2
4-53:Let T1 be the set of players j such that tj ∈ V1, and T2 be the set of players j such that tj ∈ V2 \ {s2}
4-54:Let Λ1 and Λ2 be the original game on the respective graphs G1 and G2 with players T1 ∪ T2 and T2, respectively
4-55:For every player i ∈ T2 with action Si in the game Λ let Si ∩E1 be his induced action in the game Λ1, and let Si ∩E2 be his induced action in the game Λ2
4-56:Let S be a SE in Λ1 that minimizes the cost of players in T2 (such a SE exists by the induction hypothesis and Lemma 3.2)
4-57:Let S be any SE in Λ2
4-58:We will show that the profile S = S ∪ S is a SE in the game Λ, i.e., for player j ∈ T2 we use the profile Sj = Sj ∪ Sj
4-59:Suppose by contradiction that S is not a SE
4-60:Then, there is a coalition Γ that can deviate such that the cost of every player j ∈ Γ decreases
4-61:Now, there are two cases: Case 1: Γ ⊆ T1
4-62:This is a contradiction to S being a SE
4-63:Case 2: There exists a player j ∈ Γ ∩ T2
4-64:By Lemma 3.2, player j cannot improve his cost in Λ1 so the improvement is due to Λ2
4-65:Consider the coalition Γ ∩ T2, it would still improve its cost
4-66:However, this contradicts the fact that S is a SE in Λ2
4-67:parallel composition
4-68:Follows from Lemma 3.3
4-69:While multi commodity fair connection games on series parallel graphs do not necessarily possess a SE (see Theorem 3.6), fair connection games on extension parallel graphs always possess a strong equilibrium
4-70:Theorem 3.5
4-71:Every fair connection game on an extension parallel graph possesses a strong equilibrium
4-72:87 t2 t1 s1 s2 2 2 1 3 3 1 (b)(a) a b e f c d Figure 1: Graph topologies
4-73:Proof
4-74:We prove the theorem by induction on the network size |V |
4-75:Let Λ be a fair connection game on an EPG G = (V, E)
4-76:The claim obviously holds if |V | = 2
4-77:If the graph G is a parallel composition of two EPG graphs G1 and G2, then the claim follows from Lemma 3.3
4-78:It remains to prove the claim for extension composition
4-79:Suppose the graph G is an extension composition of the graph G1 consisting of a single edge e = (s1, t1) and an EPG G2 = (V2, E2) with terminals s2, t2, such that s = s1 and t = t2
4-80:(The case that G2 is a single edge is similar.) Let T1 be the set of players with source s1 and sink t1 (i.e., their path is in G1)
4-81:Let T2 be the set of players with source and sink in G2
4-82:Let T3 be the set of players with source s1 and sink in V2 \ t1
4-83:Let Λ1 and Λ2 be the original game on the respective graphs G1 and G2 with players T1 ∪ T3 and T2 ∪ T3, respectively
4-84:Let S , S be SE in Λ1 and Λ2 respectively
4-85:We will show that the profile S = S ∪ S is a SE in the game Λ
4-86:Suppose by contradiction that S is not a SE
4-87:Then, there is a coalition Γ of minimal size that can deviate such that the cost of any player j ∈ Γ decreases
4-88:Clearly, T1 ∩Γ = φ, since players in T1 have a single strategy
4-89:Hence, Γ ⊆ T2 ∪T3
4-90:Any player j ∈ T2 ∪T3 cannot improve his cost in Λ1
4-91:Therefore, any player j ∈ T2 ∪ T3 improves his cost in Λ2
4-92:However, this contradicts the fact that S is a SE in Λ2
4-93:In the following theorem we provide a few examples of topologies in which a strong equilibrium does not exist, showing that our characterization is almost tight
4-94:Theorem 3.6
4-95:The following connection games exist: (1) There exists a multi commodity fair connection game on a series parallel graph that does not possess a strong equilibrium
4-96:(2) There exists a single source fair connection game that does not possess a strong equilibrium
4-97:Proof
4-98:For claim (1) consider the graph depicted in Figure 1(a)
4-99:This game has a unique NE where S1 = {e, c}, S2 = {b, f}, and each player has a cost of 5.7 However, consider the following coordinated deviation S
4-100:S1 = {a, b, c}, 7 In any NE of the game, player 1 will buy the edge e and player 2 will buy the edge f
4-101:This is since the alternate path, in the respective part, will cost the player 2.5
4-102:Thus, player 1 (player 2) will buy the edge c (edge b) alone, and each player will have a cost of 5

4-104:and S2 = {b, c, d}
4-105:In this profile, each player pays a cost of 4, and thus improves its cost
4-106:For claim (2) consider a single source fair connection game on the graph G depicted in Figure 2
4-107:There are two players
4-108:Player i = 1, 2 wishes to connect the source s to its sink ti and the unique NE is S1 = {a, b}, S2 = {a, c}, and each player has a cost of 2
4-109:8 Then, both players can deviate to S1 = {h, f, d} and S2 = {h, f, e}, and decrease their costs to 2 −  2
4-110:Unfortunately, our characterization is not completely tight
4-111:The graph in Figure 1(b) is an example of a non extension parallel graph which always admits a strong equilibrium
4-112:3.2 Strong Price of Anarchy While the price of anarchy in fair connection games can be as bad as n, the following theorem shows that the strong price of anarchy is bounded by H(n) = n i=1 1 i = Θ(log n)
4-113:Theorem 3.7
4-114:The strong price of anarchy of a fair connection game with n players is at most H(n)
4-115:Proof
4-116:Let Λ be a fair connection game on the graph G
4-117:We denote by Λ(Γ) the game played on the graph G by a set of players Γ, where the action of player i ∈ Γ remains Σi (the same as in Λ)

4-121:, Sn) be a profile in the game Γ in the game Λ(Γ)
4-122:Let ne(S(Γ)) denote the load of edge e under the profile S(Γ) in the game Λ(Γ), i.e., ne(S(Γ)) = |{j|j ∈ Γ, e ∈ Sj}|
4-123:Similar to congestion games [16, 13] we denote by Φ(S(Γ)) the potential function of the profile S(Γ) in the game Λ(Γ), where Φ(S(Γ)) = e∈E ne(S(Γ)) j=1 fe(j), and define Φ(S(φ)) = 0
4-124:In our case, it holds that Φ(S) = e∈E ce · H(ne(S))
4-125:(1) Let S be a SE, and let S∗ be the profile of the optimal solution
4-126:We define an order on the players as follows
4-127:Let Γn = {1, ..., n} be the set of all the players
4-128:For each k = 8 We can show that this is the unique NE by a simple case analysis: (i) If S1 = {h, f, d} and S2 = {h, f, e}, then player 1 can deviate to S1 = {h, g} and decrease his cost
4-129:(ii) If S1 = {h, g} and S2 = {h, f, e}, then player 2 can deviate to S2 = {a, c} and decrease his cost
4-130:(iii) If S1 = {h, g} and S2 = {a, c}, then player 1 can deviate to S1 = {a, b} and decrease his cost

4-135:call it player k, such that, ck(S) ≤ ck(S−Γk , S∗ Γk In this section, we derive our results for general connection games
4-136:4.1 Existence of Strong Equilibrium We begin with a characterization of the existence of a strong equilibrium in symmetric general connection games
4-137:Similar to Theorem 3.1 (using a similar proof) we establish, Theorem 4.1
4-138:In every symmetric fair connection game there exists a strong equilibrium
4-139:While every single source general connection game possesses a pure Nash equilibrium [3], it does not necessarily admit some strong equilibrium.11 10 This is a variation on the example given in [2]
4-140:11 We thank Elliot Anshelevich, whose similar topology for the fair connection game inspired this example
4-141:Theorem 4.2
4-142:There exists a single source general connection game that does not admit any strong equilibrium
4-143:Proof
4-144:Consider single source general connection game with 3 players on the graph depicted in Figure 4
4-145:Player i wishes to connect the source s with its sink ti.We need to consider only the NE profiles: (i) if all three players use the link of cost 3, then there must be two agents whose total sum exceeds 2, thus they can both reduce cost by deviating to an edge of cost 2−
4-146:(ii) if two of the players use an edge of cost 2− jointly, and the third player uses a different edge of cost 2 − , then, the players with non zero payments can deviate to the path with the edge of cost 3 and reduce their costs (since before the deviation the total payments of the players is 4 − 2 )
4-147:We showed that none of the NE are SE, and thus the game does not possess any SE
4-148:Next we show that for the class of series parallel graphs, there is always a strong equilibrium in the case of a single source
4-149:Theorem 4.3
4-150:In every single source general connection game on a series parallel graph, there exists a strong equilibrium
4-151:Proof
4-152:Let Λ be a single source general connection game on a SPG G = (V, E) with source s and sink t
4-153:We present an algorithm that constructs a specific SE
4-154:We first consider the following partial order between the players
4-155:For players i and j, we have that i → j if there is a directed path from ti to tj
4-156:We complete the partial order to a full order (in an arbitrary way), and w.l.o.g
4-157:we assume that 1 → 2 → · · · → n
4-158:The algorithm COMPUTE SE, considers the players in an increasing order, starting with player 1
4-159:Each player i will fully buy a subset of the edges, and any player j > i will consider the cost of those (bought) edges as zero
4-160:When COMPUTE SE considers player j, the cost of the edges that players 1 to j−1 have bought is set to zero, and player j fully buys a shortest path Qj from s to tj
4-161:Namely, for every edges e ∈ Qj \ ∪i<jQi we have pj(e) = ce and otherwise pj(e) = 0
4-162:We next show that the algorithm COMPUTESE computes a SE
4-163:Assume by way of contradiction that the profile p is not a SE
4-164:Then, there exists a coalition that can improve the costs of all its players by a deviation
4-165:Let Γ be such a coalition of minimal size and let player i = max{j ∈ Γ}
4-166:For a player j ∈ Γ let ¯Qj and ¯pj be the path and payment of player j after the deviation, respectively
4-167:Let Q be a path from the sink of player i, i.e
4-168:ti, to the sink of G, i.e
4-169:t
4-170:Then Q = ¯Qi ∪ Q is a path from the source s to the sink t
4-171:For any player j < i, let yj be the intersecting vertex of Q and tj (by Lemma 2.1 one is guarantee to exist)
4-172:Let y be the furthest vertex on the path Q such that y = yj for some j < i
4-173:The path from the source s to node y was fully paid for by players j < i in p (before the deviation)
4-174:There are two cases we consider
4-175:case a: After the deviation player i does not pay for edges in j∈Γ\{i} ¯Qj
4-176:This is a contradiction to the minimality of the coalition Γ size, since the players in Γ \ {i} can form a smaller coalition with payments ¯p
4-177:case b: Otherwise, we show that player i cost after the deviation, i.e
4-178:ci(¯p), is at least his cost before the deviation, i.e
4-179:ci(p), contradicting the fact that player i improved his cost
4-180:Recall that given two vertices u, v on path ¯Q we denote by ¯Qu,v the subpath of ¯Q from u to v
4-181:90 Before the deviation of the coalition Γ, a path from s to y was fully paid for by the players j < i
4-182:Next we show that no player k > i pays for any edge on any path from s to ti
4-183:Consider a player k > i and let Qk = Qk ∪ Qk , where Qk is a path connecting tk to t
4-184:Let yk be the intersecting vertex of Qk and ti
4-185:Since there exists a path from s to yk that was fully paid for by players j < k before the deviation, in particularly the path Qi s,yk , player k will not pay for any edge on any path connecting s and yk
4-186:Therefore player i fully pays for all edges on the path ¯Qi y,ti , i.e., ¯pi(e) = ce for all edges e ∈ ¯Qi y,ti
4-187:Now consider the algorithm COMPUTESE at the step when player i selects a shortest path from the source s to its sink ti and determines his payment pi
4-188:At this point, player i could buy the path ¯Qi y,ti , since a path from s to y was already paid for by players j < i
4-189:Hence, ci(¯p) ≥ ci(p)
4-190:This contradicts the fact that player i improved its cost and therefore not all the players in Γ reduce their cost
4-191:This implies that p is a strong equilibrium
4-192:4.2 Strong Price of Anarchy While for every single source general connection game, it holds that PoS = 1 [3], the price of anarchy can be as large as n, even for two parallel edges
4-193:Here, we show that any strong equilibrium in single source general connection games yields the optimal cost
4-194:Theorem 4.4
4-195:In single source general connection game, if there exists a strong equilibrium, then the strong price of anarchy is 1
4-196:Proof
4-197:Let p = (p1,
4-198:
4-199:
4-200:, pn) be a strong equilibrium, and let T∗ be the minimum cost Steiner tree on all players, rooted at the (single) source s
4-201:Let T∗ e be the subtree of T∗ disconnected from s when edge e is removed
4-202:Let Γ(Te) be the set of players which have sinks in Te
4-203:For a set of edges E, let c(E) = e∈E ce
4-204:Let P(Te) = i∈Γ(Te) ci(p)
4-205:Assume by way of contradiction that c(p) > c(T∗
