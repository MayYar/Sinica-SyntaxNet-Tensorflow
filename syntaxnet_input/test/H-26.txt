2 INTRODUCTION :
2-1:State of the art information retrieval systems commonly use machine learning techniques to learn ranking functions .
2-2:However, most current approaches do not optimize for the evaluation measure most often used, namely Mean Average Precision .
2-3:Instead, current algorithms tend to take one of two general approaches .
2-4:The first approach is to learn a model that estimates the probability of a document being relevant given a query (e.g., [18, 14]) .
2-5:If solved effectively, the ranking with best MAP performance can easily be derived from the probabilities of relevance .
2-6:However, achieving high MAP only requires finding a good ordering of the documents .
2-7:As a result, finding good probabilities requires solving a more difficult problem than necessary, likely requiring more training data to achieve the same MAP performance .
2-8:The second common approach is to learn a function that maximizes a surrogate measure .
2-9:Performance measures optimized include accuracy [17, 15], ROCArea [1, 5, 10, 11, 13, 21] or modifications of ROCArea [4], and NDCG [2, 3] .
2-10:Learning a model to optimize for such measures might result in suboptimal MAP performance .
2-11:In fact, although some previous systems have obtained good MAP performance, it is known that neither achieving optimal accuracy nor ROCArea can guarantee optimal MAP performance[7] .
2-12:In this paper, we present a general approach for learning ranking functions that maximize MAP performance .
2-13:Specifically, we present an SVM algorithm that globally optimizes a hinge loss relaxation of MAP .
2-14:This approach simplifies the process of obtaining ranking functions with high MAP performance by avoiding additional intermediate steps and heuristics .
2-15:The new algorithm also makes it conceptually just as easy to optimize SVMs for MAP as was previously possible only for accuracy and ROCArea .
2-16:In contrast to recent work directly optimizing for MAP performance by Metzler & Croft [16] and Caruana et al .
2-17:[6], our technique is computationally efficient while finding a globally optimal solution .
2-18:Like [6, 16], our method learns a linear model, but is much more efficient in practice and, unlike [16], can handle many thousands of features .
2-19:We now describe the algorithm in detail and provide proof of correctness .
2-20:Following this, we provide an analysis of running time .
2-21:We finish with empirical results from experiments on the TREC 9 and TREC 10 Web Track corpus .
2-22:We have also developed a software package implementing our algorithm that is available for public use1 . .
3 THE LEARNING PROBLEM :
3-1:Following the standard machine learning setup, our goal is to learn a function h : X → Y between an input space X (all possible queries) and output space Y (rankings over a corpus) .
3-2:In order to quantify the quality of a prediction, ˆy = h(x), we will consider a loss function ∆ : Y × Y → .
3-3:∆(y, ˆy) quantifies the penalty for making prediction ˆy if the correct output is y .
3-4:The loss function allows us to incorporate specific performance measures, which we will exploit 1 http: svmrank.yisongyue.com for optimizing MAP .
3-5:We restrict ourselves to the supervised learning scenario, where input output pairs (x, y) are available for training and are assumed to come from some fixed distribution P(x, y) .
3-6:The goal is to find a function h such that the risk (i.e., expected loss), R∆ P (h) = Z X×Y ∆(y, h(x))dP(x, y), is minimized .
3-7:Of course, P(x, y) is unknown .
3-8:But given a finite set of training pairs, S = {(xi, yi) ∈ X × Y : i = 1, .
3-9:.
3-10:.
3-11:, n}, the performance of h on S can be measured by the empirical risk, R∆ S (h) = 1 n nX i=1 ∆(yi, h(xi)) .
3-12:In the case of learning a ranked retrieval function, X denotes a space of queries, and Y the space of (possibly weak) rankings over some corpus of documents C = {d1, .
3-13:.
3-14:.
3-15:,d|C|} .
3-16:We can define average precision loss as ∆map(y, ˆy) = 1 − MAP(rank(y), rank(ˆy)), where rank(y) is a vector of the rank values of each document in C .
3-17:For example, for a corpus of two documents, {d1, d2}, with d1 having higher rank than d2, rank(y ) = (1, 0) .
3-18:We assume true rankings have two rank values, where relevant documents have rank value 1 and non relevant documents rank value 0 .
3-19:We further assume that all predicted rankings are complete rankings (no ties) .
3-20:Let p = rank(y) and ˆp = rank(ˆy) .
3-21:The average precision score is defined as MAP(p, ˆp) = 1 rel X j:pj =1 Prec@j, where rel = |{i : pi = 1}| is the number of relevant documents, and Prec@j is the percentage of relevant documents in the top j documents in predicted ranking ˆy .
3-22:MAP is the mean of the average precision scores of a group of queries .
3-23:2.1 MAP vs ROCArea Most learning algorithms optimize for accuracy or ROCArea .
3-24:While optimizing for these measures might achieve good MAP performance, we use two simple examples to show it can also be suboptimal in terms of MAP .
3-25:ROCArea assigns equal penalty to each misordering of a relevant non relevant pair .
3-26:In contrast, MAP assigns greater penalties to misorderings higher up in the predicted ranking .
3-27:Using our notation, ROCArea can be defined as ROC(p, ˆp) = 1 rel · (|C| − rel) X i:pi=1 X j:pj =0 1[ˆpi>ˆpj ], where p is the true (weak) ranking, ˆp is the predicted ranking, and 1[b] is the indicator function conditioned on b .

3-29:These two hypotheses predict a ranking for query x over a corpus of eight documents .

3-31:Here, a learning method which optimizes for ROCArea would choose h2 since that results in a higher ROCArea score, but this yields a suboptimal MAP score .
3-32:2.2 MAP vs Accuracy Using a very similar example, we now demonstrate how optimizing for accuracy might result in suboptimal MAP .
3-33:Models which optimize for accuracy are not directly concerned with the ranking .
3-34:Instead, they learn a threshold such that documents scoring higher than the threshold can be classified as relevant and documents scoring lower as nonrelevant .
3-35:Doc ID 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 p 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 rank(h1(x)) 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 rank(h2(x)) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Table 3: Toy Example and Models We consider again a hypothesis space with two hypotheses .
3-36:Table 3 shows the predictions of the two hypotheses on a single query x .
3-37:Hypothesis MAP Best Acc .

3-39:The best accuracy refers to the highest achievable accuracy on that ranking when considering all possible thresholds .
3-40:For instance, with h1(q), a threshold between documents 1 and 2 gives 4 errors (documents 6 9 incorrectly classified as non relevant), yielding an accuracy of 0.64 .
3-41:Similarly, with h2(q), a threshold between documents 5 and 6 gives 3 errors (documents 10 11 incorrectly classified as relevant, and document 1 as non relevant), yielding an accuracy of 0.73 .
3-42:A learning method which optimizes for accuracy would choose h2 since that results in a higher accuracy score, but this yields a suboptimal MAP score. .
4 OPTIMIZING AVERAGE PRECISION :
4-1:We build upon the approach used by [13] for optimizing ROCArea .
4-2:Unlike ROCArea, however, MAP does not decompose linearly in the examples and requires a substantially extended algorithm, which we describe in this section .
4-3:Recall that the true ranking is a weak ranking with two rank values (relevant and non relevant) .
4-4:Let Cx and C¯x denote the set of relevant and non relevant documents of C for query x, respectively .
4-5:We focus on functions which are parametrized by a weight vector w, and thus wish to find w to minimize the empirical risk, R∆ S (w) ≡ R∆ S (h(·; w)) .
4-6:Our approach is to learn a discriminant function F : X × Y → over input output pairs .
4-7:Given query x, we can derive a prediction by finding the ranking y that maximizes the discriminant function: h(x; w) = argmax y∈Y F(x, y; w) .
4-8:(1) We assume F to be linear in some combined feature representation of inputs and outputs Ψ(x, y) ∈ RN , i.e., F(x, y; w) = wT Ψ(x, y) .
4-9:(2) The combined feature function we use is Ψ(x, y) = 1 |Cx| · |C¯x| X i:di∈Cx X j:dj ∈C¯x [yij (φ(x, di) − φ(x, dj))] , where φ : X × C → N is a feature mapping function from a query document pair to a point in N dimensional space2 .
4-10:We represent rankings as a matrix of pairwise orderings, Y ⊂ {−1, 0, +1}|C|×|C| .
4-11:For any y ∈ Y, yij = +1 if di is ranked ahead of dj, and yij = −1 if dj is ranked ahead of di, and yij = 0 if di and dj have equal rank .
4-12:We consider only matrices which correspond to valid rankings (i.e, obeying antisymmetry and transitivity) .
4-13:Intuitively, Ψ is a summation over the vector differences of all relevant non relevant document pairings .
4-14:Since we assume predicted rankings to be complete rankings, yij is either +1 or −1 (never 0) .
4-15:Given a learned weight vector w, predicting a ranking (i.e .
4-16:solving equation (1)) given query x reduces to picking each yij to maximize wT Ψ(x, y) .
4-17:As is also discussed in [13], this is attained by sorting the documents by wT φ(x, d) in descending order .
4-18:We will discuss later the choices of φ we used for our experiments .
4-19:3.1 Structural SVMs The above formulation is very similar to learning a straightforward linear model while training on the pairwise difference of relevant non relevant document pairings .
4-20:Many SVM based approaches optimize over these pairwise differences (e.g., [5, 10, 13, 4]), although these methods do not optimize for MAP during training .
4-21:Previously, it was not clear how to incorporate non linear multivariate loss functions such as MAP loss directly into global optimization problems such as SVM training .
4-22:We now present a method based on structural SVMs [19] to address this problem .
4-23:We use the structural SVM formulation, presented in Optimization Problem 1, to learn a w ∈ RN .
4-24:Optimization Problem 1 .

4-27:As is usual in SVM training, C is a 2 For example, one dimension might be the number of times the query words appear in the document .

4-39:For each (xi, yi) in the training set, a set of constraints of the form in equation (4) is added to the optimization problem .
4-40:Note that wT Ψ(x, y) is exactly our discriminant function F(x, y; w) (see equation (2)) .
4-41:During prediction, our model chooses the ranking which maximizes the discriminant (1) .
4-42:If the discriminant value for an incorrect ranking y is greater than for the true ranking yi (e.g., F(xi, y; w) > F(xi, yi; w)), then corresponding slack variable, ξi, must be at least ∆(yi, y) for that constraint to be satisfied .
4-43:Therefore, the sum of slacks, P ξi, upper bounds the MAP loss .
4-44:This is stated formally in Proposition 1 .
4-45:Proposition 1 .
4-46:Let ξ∗ (w) be the optimal solution of the slack variables for OP 1 for a given weight vector w .
4-47:Then 1 n Pn i=1 ξi is an upper bound on the empirical risk R∆ S (w) .
4-48:(see [19] for proof) Proposition 1 shows that OP 1 learns a ranking function that optimizes an upper bound on MAP error on the training set .
4-49:Unfortunately there is a problem: a constraint is required for every possible wrong output y, and the number of possible wrong outputs is exponential in the size of Algorithm 1 is a cutting plane algorithm, iteratively introducing constraints until we have solved the original problem within a desired tolerance [19] .
4-50:The algorithm starts with no constraints, and iteratively finds for each example (xi, yi) the output ˆy associated with the most violated constraint .
4-51:If the corresponding constraint is violated by more than we introduce ˆy into the working set Wi of active constraints for example i, and re solve (3) using the updated W .
4-52:It can be shown that Algorithm 1"s outer loop is guaranteed to halt within a polynomial number of iterations for any desired precision .
4-53:Theorem 1 .
4-54:Let ¯R = maxi maxy Ψ(xi, yi) − Ψ(xi, y) , ¯∆ = maxi maxy ∆(yi, y), and for any > 0, Algorithm 1 terminates after adding at most max  2n ¯∆ , 8C ¯∆ ¯R2 2 ff constraints to the working set W .
4-55:(see [19] for proof) However, within the inner loop of this algorithm we have to compute argmaxy∈Y H(y; w), where H(y; w) = ∆(yi, y) + wT Ψ(xi, y) − wT Ψ(xi, yi), or equivalently, argmax y∈Y ∆(yi, y) + wT Ψ(xi, y), since wT Ψ(xi, yi) is constant with respect to y .
4-56:Though closely related to the classification procedure, this has the substantial complication that we must contend with the additional ∆(yi, y) term .
4-57:Without the ability to efficiently find the most violated constraint (i.e., solve argmaxy∈Y H(y, w)), the constraint generation procedure is not tractable .
4-58:3.2 Finding the Most Violated Constraint Using OP 1 and optimizing to ROCArea loss (∆roc), the problem of finding the most violated constraint, or solving argmaxy∈Y H(y, w) (henceforth argmax H), is addressed in [13] .
4-59:Solving argmax H for ∆map is more difficult .
4-60:This is primarily because ROCArea decomposes nicely into a sum of scores computed independently on each relative ordering of a relevant non relevant document pair .
4-61:MAP, on the other hand, does not decompose in the same way as ROCArea .
4-62:The main algorithmic contribution of this paper is an efficient method for solving argmax H for ∆map .
4-63:One useful property of ∆map is that it is invariant to swapping two documents with equal relevance .
4-64:For example, if documents da and db are both relevant, then swapping the positions of da and db in any ranking does not affect ∆map .
4-65:By extension, ∆map is invariant to any arbitrary permutation of the relevant documents amongst themselves and of the non relevant documents amongst themselves .
4-66:However, this reshuﬄing will affect the discriminant score, wT Ψ(x, y) .
4-67:This leads us to Observation 1 .
4-68:Observation 1 .
4-69:Consider rankings which are constrained by fixing the relevance at each position in the ranking (e.g., the 3rd document in the ranking must be relevant) .
4-70:Every ranking which satisfies the same set of constraints will have the same ∆map .
4-71:If the relevant documents are sorted by wT φ(x, d) in descending order, and the non relevant documents are likewise sorted by wT φ(x, d), then the interleaving of the two sorted lists which satisfies the constraints will maximize H for that constrained set of rankings .
4-72:Observation 1 implies that in the ranking which maximizes H, the relevant documents will be sorted by wT φ(x, d), and the non relevant documents will also be sorted likewise .
4-73:By first sorting the relevant and non relevant documents, the problem is simplified to finding the optimal interleaving of two sorted lists .
4-74:For the rest of our discussion, we assume that the relevant documents and non relevant documents are both sorted by descending wT φ(x, d) .
4-75:For convenience, we also refer to relevant documents as {dx 1 , .

4-82:We define δj(i1, i2), with i1 < i2, as the change in H from when the highest ranked relevant document ranked after d¯x j is dx i1 to when it is dx i2 .
4-83:For i2 = i1 + 1, we have δj(i, i + 1) = 1 |Cx| „ j j + i − j − 1 j + i − 1 « − 2 · (sx i − s¯x j ), (5) where si = wT φ(x, di) .
4-84:The first term in (5) is the change in ∆map when the ith relevant document has j non relevant documents ranked before it, as opposed to j −1 .
4-85:The second term is the change in the discriminant score, wT Ψ(x, y), when yij changes from +1 to −1 .

4-100:The difference in the value of H for these two rankings is exactly δj(i, i + 1) .
4-101:For any i1 < i2, we can then define δj(i1, i2) as δj(i1, i2) = i2−1 X k=i1 δj(k, k + 1), (6) or equivalently, δj(i1, i2) = i2−1 X k=i1 » 1 |Cx| „ j j + k − j − 1 j + k − 1 « − 2 · (sx k − s¯x j ) .

4-136:(10) If the solution is feasible, the it clearly solves (8) .
4-137:Therefore, it suffices to prove that Algorithm 2 satisfies (10) .
4-138:We first prove that δj(·, ·) is monotonically decreasing in j .
4-139:Lemma 1 .
4-140:For any 1 ≤ i1 < i2 ≤ |Cx | + 1 and 1 ≤ j < |C¯x |, it must be the case that δj+1(i1, i2) ≤ δj(i1, i2) .
4-141:Proof .
4-142:Recall from (6) that both δj(i1, i2) and δj+1(i1, i2) are summations of i2 − i1 terms .
4-143:We will show that each term in the summation of δj+1(i1, i2) is no greater than the corresponding term in δj(i1, i2), or δj+1(k, k + 1) ≤ δj(k, k + 1) for k = i1, .
4-144:.
4-145:.
4-146:, i2 − 1 .
4-147:Each term in δj(k, k +1) and δj+1(k, k +1) can be further decomposed into two parts (see (5)) .
4-148:We will show that each part of δj+1(k, k + 1) is no greater than the corresponding part in δj(k, k + 1) .
4-149:In other words, we will show that both j + 1 j + k + 1 − j j + k ≤ j j + k − j − 1 j + k − 1 (11) and −2 · (sx k − s¯x j+1) ≤ −2 · (sx k − s¯x j ) (12) are true for the aforementioned values of j and k .
4-150:It is easy to see that (11) is true by observing that for any two positive integers 1 ≤ a < b, a + 1 b + 1 − a b ≤ a b − a − 1 b − 1 , and choosing a = j and b = j + k .
4-151:The second inequality (12) holds because Algorithm 2 first sorts d¯x in descending order of s¯x , implying s¯x j+1 ≤ s¯x j .
4-152:Thus we see that each term in δj+1 is no greater than the corresponding term in δj, which completes the proof .
4-153:The result of Lemma 1 leads directly to our main correctness result: Theorem 2 .
4-154:In Algorithm 2, the computed values of optj satisfy (10), implying that the solution returned by Algorithm 2 is feasible and thus optimal .
4-155:Proof .
4-156:We will prove that optj ≤ optj+1 holds for any 1 ≤ j < |C¯x |, thus implying (10) .
4-157:Since Algorithm 2 computes optj as optj = argmax k δj(k, |Cx | + 1), (13) then by definition of δj (6), for any 1 ≤ i < optj, δj(i, optj) = δj(i, |Cx | + 1) − δj(optj, |Cx | + 1) < 0 .
4-158:Using Lemma 1, we know that δj+1(i, optj) ≤ δj(i, optj) < 0, which implies that for any 1 ≤ i < optj, δj+1(i, |Cx | + 1) − δj+1(optj, |Cx | + 1) < 0 .
4-159:Suppose for contradiction that optj+1 < optj .
4-160:Then δj+1(optj+1, |Cx | + 1) < δj+1(optj, |Cx | + 1), which contradicts (13) .
4-161:Therefore, it must be the case that optj ≤ optj+1, which completes the proof .
4-162:3.2.2 Running Time The running time of Algorithm 2 can be split into two parts .
4-163:The first part is the sort by wT φ(x, d), which requires O(n log n) time, where n = |Cx | + |C¯x The main goal of our experiments is to evaluate whether directly optimizing MAP leads to improved MAP performance compared to conventional SVM methods that optimize a substitute loss such as accuracy or ROCArea .
4-164:We empirically evaluate our method using two sets of TREC Web Track queries, one each from TREC 9 and TREC 10 (topics 451 500 and 501 550), both of which used the WT10g corpus .
4-165:For each query, TREC provides the relevance judgments of the documents .
4-166:We generated our features using the scores of existing retrieval functions on these queries .
4-167:While our method is agnostic to the meaning of the features, we chose to use existing retrieval functions as a simple yet effective way of acquiring useful features .
4-168:As such, our 3 http: www.cs.cornell.edu ~tomf svmpython 4 http: svmlight.joachims.org svm_struct.html Dataset Base Funcs Features TREC 9 Indri 15 750 TREC 10 Indri 15 750 TREC 9 Submissions 53 2650 TREC 10 Submissions 18 900 Table 5: Dataset Statistics experiments essentially test our method"s ability to re rank the highly ranked documents (e.g., re combine the scores of the retrieval functions) to improve MAP .
4-169:We compare our method against the best retrieval functions trained on (henceforth base functions), as well as against previously proposed SVM methods .
4-170:Comparing with the best base functions tests our method"s ability to learn a useful combination .
4-171:Comparing with previous SVM methods allows us to test whether optimizing directly for MAP (as opposed to accuracy or ROCArea) achieves a higher MAP score in practice .
4-172:The rest of this section describes the base functions and the feature generation method in detail .
4-173:4.1 Choosing Retrieval Functions We chose two sets of base functions for our experiments .
4-174:For the first set, we generated three indices over the WT10g corpus using Indri5 .
4-175:The first index was generated using default settings, the second used Porter stemming, and the last used Porter stemming and Indri"s default stopwords .
4-176:For both TREC 9 and TREC 10, we used the description portion of each query and scored the documents using five of Indri"s built in retrieval methods, which are Cosine Similarity, TFIDF, Okapi, Language Model with Dirichlet Prior, and Language Model with Jelinek Mercer Prior .
4-177:All parameters were kept as their defaults .
4-178:We computed the scores of these five retrieval methods over the three indices, giving 15 base functions in total .
4-179:For each query, we considered the scores of documents found in the union of the top 1000 documents of each base function .
4-180:For our second set of base functions, we used scores from the TREC 9 [8] and TREC 10 [9] Web Track submissions .
4-181:We used only the non manual, non short submissions from both years .
4-182:For TREC 9 and TREC 10, there were 53 and 18 such submissions, respectively .
4-183:A typical submission contained scores of its top 1000 documents .

4-187:From a high level, we are expressing the score of each retrieval function using |Kf | + 1 bins .
4-188:Since we are using linear kernels, one can think of the learning problem as finding a good piecewise constant combination of the scores of the retrieval functions .
4-189:Figure 2 shows an example of our feature mapping method .
4-190:In this example we have a single feature F = {f} .
4-191:Here, Kf = {a, b, c}, and the weight vector is w = wa, wb, wc .
4-192:For any document d and query x, we have wT φ(x, d) = 8 >>< >>: 0 if f(d|x) < a wa if a ≤ f(d|x) < b wa + wb if b ≤ f(d|x) < c wa + wb + wc if c ≤ f(d|x) .
4-193:This is expressed qualitatively in Figure 2, where wa and wb are positive, and wc is negative .
4-194:We ran our main experiments using four choices of F: the set of aforementioned Indri retrieval functions for TREC 9 and TREC 10, and the Web Track submissions for TREC 9 and TREC 10 .
4-195:For each F and each function f ∈ F, we chose 50 values for Kf which are reasonably spaced and capture the sensitive region of f .
4-196:Using the four choices of F, we generated four datasets for our main experiments .
4-197:Table 5 contains statistics of the generated datasets .
4-198:There are many ways to generate features, and we are not advocating our method over others .
4-199:This was simply an efficient means to normalize the outputs of different functions and allow for a more expressive model. .
5 EXPERIMENTS :
5-1:For each dataset in Table 5, we performed 50 trials .
5-2:For each trial, we train on 10 randomly selected queries, and select another 5 queries at random for a validation set .
5-3:Models were trained using a wide range of C values .
5-4:The model which performed best on the validation set was selected and tested on the remaining 35 queries .
5-5:All queries were selected to be in the training, validation and test sets the same number of times .
5-6:Using this setup, we performed the same experiments while using our method (SVM∆ map), an SVM optimizing for ROCArea (SVM∆ roc) [13], and a conventional classification SVM (SVMacc) [20] .
5-7:All SVM methods used a linear kernel .
5-8:We reported the average performance of all models over the 50 trials .
5-9:5.1 Comparison with Base Functions In analyzing our results, the first question to answer is, can SVM∆ map learn a model which outperforms the best base TREC 9 TREC 10 Model MAP W L MAP W L SVM∆ map 0.290 0.287Best Func .

5-12:(w o best) functions? Table 6 presents the comparison of SVM∆ map with the best Indri base functions .
5-13:Each column group contains the macro averaged MAP performance of SVM∆ map or a base function .
5-14:The W L columns show the number of queries where SVM∆ map achieved a higher MAP score .
5-15:Significance tests were performed using the two tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test .
5-16:Two stars indicate a significance level of 0.95 .
5-17:All tables displaying our experimental results are structured identically .
5-18:Here, we find that SVM∆ map significantly outperforms the best base functions .
5-19:Table 7 shows the comparison when trained on TREC submissions .
5-20:While achieving a higher MAP score than the best base functions, the performance difference between SVM∆ map the base functions is not significant .
5-21:Given that many of these submissions use scoring functions which are carefully crafted to achieve high MAP, it is possible that the best performing submissions use techniques which subsume the techniques of the other submissions .
5-22:As a result, SVM∆ map would not be able to learn a hypothesis which can significantly out perform the best submission .
5-23:Hence, we ran the same experiments using a modified dataset where the features computed using the best submission were removed .
5-24:Table 8 shows the results (note that we are still comparing against the best submission though we are not using it for training) .
5-25:Notice that while the performance of SVM∆ map degraded slightly, the performance was still comparable with that of the best submission .
5-26:5.2 Comparison w Previous SVM Methods The next question to answer is, does SVM∆ map produce higher MAP scores than previous SVM methods? Tables 9 and 10 present the results of SVM∆ map, SVM∆ roc, and SVMacc when trained on the Indri retrieval functions and TREC submissions, respectively .
5-27:Table 11 contains the corresponding results when trained on the TREC submissions without the best submission .
5-28:To start with, our results indicate that SVMacc was not competitive with SVM∆ map and SVM∆ roc, and at times underperformed dramatically .
5-29:As such, we tried several approaches to improve the performance of SVMacc .
5-30:5.2.1 Alternate SVMacc Methods One issue which may cause SVMacc to underperform is the severe imbalance between relevant and non relevant docTREC 9 TREC 10 Model MAP W L MAP W L SVM∆ map 0.242 0.236SVM∆ roc 0.237 29 21 0.234 24 26 SVMacc 0.147 47 3 ** 0.155 47 3 ** SVMacc2 0.219 39 11 ** 0.207 43 7 ** SVMacc3 0.113 49 1 ** 0.153 45 5 ** SVMacc4 0.155 48 2 ** 0.155 48 2 ** Table 9: Trained on Indri Functions TREC 9 TREC 10 Model MAP W L MAP W L SVM∆ map 0.290 0.287SVM∆ roc 0.282 29 21 0.278 35 15 ** SVMacc 0.213 49 1 ** 0.222 49 1 ** SVMacc2 0.270 34 16 ** 0.261 42 8 ** SVMacc3 0.133 50 0 ** 0.182 46 4 ** SVMacc4 0.233 47 3 ** 0.238 46 4 ** Table 10: Trained on TREC Submissions uments .
5-31:The vast majority of the documents are not relevant .
5-32:SVMacc2 addresses this problem by assigning more penalty to false negative errors .
5-33:For each dataset, the ratio of the false negative to false positive penalties is equal to the ratio of the number non relevant and relevant documents in that dataset .
5-34:Tables 9, 10 and 11 indicate that SVMacc2 still performs significantly worse than SVM∆ map .
5-35:Another possible issue is that SVMacc attempts to find just one discriminating threshold b that is query invariant .
5-36:It may be that different queries require different values of (when one does not exist) may be detrimental .
5-37:We took two approaches to address this issue .
5-38:The first method, SVMacc3, converts the retrieval function scores into percentiles .
5-39:For example, for document d, query q and retrieval function f, if the score f(d|q) is in the top 90% of the scores f(·|q) for query q, then the converted score is f (d|q) = 0.9 .
5-40:Each Kf contains 50 evenly spaced values between 0 and 1 .
5-41:Tables 9, 10 and 11 show that the performance of SVMacc3 was also not competitive with SVM∆ map .
5-42:The second method, SVMacc4, normalizes the scores given by f for each query .
5-43:For example, assume for query q that f outputs scores in the range 0.2 to 0.7 .
5-44:Then for document d, if f(d|q) = 0.6, the converted score would be f (d|q) = (0.6 − 0.2) (0.7 − 0.2) = 0.8 .
5-45:Each Kf contains 50 evenly spaced values between 0 and 1 .
5-46:Again, Tables 9, 10 and 11 show that SVMacc4 was not competitive with SVM∆ map 5.2.2 MAP vs ROCArea SVM∆ roc performed much better than SVMacc in our experiments .
5-47:When trained on Indri retrieval functions (see Table 9), the performance of SVM∆ roc was slight, though not significantly, worse than the performances of SVM∆ map .
5-48:However, Table 10 shows that SVM∆ map did significantly outperform SVM∆ roc when trained on the TREC submissions .
5-49:Table 11 shows the performance of the models when trained on the TREC submissions with the best submission removed .
5-50:The performance of most models degraded by a small amount, with SVM∆ map still having the best performance .

6 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK :
6-1:We have presented an SVM method that directly optimizes MAP .
6-2:It provides a principled approach and avoids difficult to control heuristics .
6-3:We formulated the optimization problem and presented an algorithm which provably finds the solution in polynomial time .
6-4:We have shown empirically that our method is generally superior to or competitive with conventional SVMs methods .
6-5:Our new method makes it conceptually just as easy to optimize SVMs for MAP as was previously possible only for Accuracy and ROCArea .
6-6:The computational cost for training is very reasonable in practice .
6-7:Since other methods typically require tuning multiple heuristics, we also expect to train fewer models before finding one which achieves good performance .
6-8:The learning framework used by our method is fairly general .
6-9:A natural extension of this framework would be to develop methods to optimize for other important IR measures, such as Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain [2, 3, 4, 12] and Mean Reciprocal Rank. .
