This section discusses the design and derivation of a solution for collecting metrics in order to support the adaptation of applications via object migration .
The solution, although implemented within the MobJeX framework, is for the most part discussed in generic terms, except where explicitly stated to be MobJeX specific .
3.1 Metrics Selection The metrics of Ryan and Rossi [9] have been chosen as the basis for this solution, since they are specifically intended for mobile application adaptation as well as having been derived from a series of mathematical models and empirically validated .
Furthermore, the metrics were empirically shown to improve the application performance in a real adaptation scenario following a change in the execution environment .
It would however be beyond the scope of this paper to implement and test the full suite of metrics listed in [9], and thus in order to provide a useful non random subset, we chose to implement the minimum set of metrics necessary to implement local and global adaptation [9] and thereby satisfy a range of real adaptation scenarios .
As such the solution presented in this section is discussed primarily in terms of these metrics, although the structure of the solution is intended to support the implementation of the remaining metrics, as well as other unspecified metrics such as those related to quality and resource utilisation .
This subset is listed below and categorised according to metric type .
Note that some additional metrics were used for implementation purposes in order to derive core metrics or assist the evaluation, and as such are defined in context where appropriate. .
