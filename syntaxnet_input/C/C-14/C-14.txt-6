it need not be detected at any point u lying between any two adjacent grid points of P .
We therefore subdivide any path P as a chain of grid segments .
Let us consider two adjacent points, say v1 and v2 on the grid .
Let l denote the line segment between v1 and v2 .
Also, let ml denote the probability of not detecting a target traveling between v1 and v2 on the line segment l .
Then, from the discussion above, log ml = u?l log(1 ? D(u))du (3) The probability ml can be evaluated by finding the detection probability D(u) at each point u ? l .
Note that, ml lies between 0 and 1 and, therefore, log ml is negative .
To find the least exposed path, a non negative weight equal to | log ml| is assigned to each segment l on this grid .
Also, a fictitious point a is created and a line segment is added from a to each grid point on the west periphery of the sensor field .
A weight equal to 0 is assigned to each of these line segments .
Similarly, a fictitious point b is created and a line segment is added from b to each grid point on the east periphery of the sensor field .
A weight equal to 0 is assigned to each of these line segments .
The problem of finding the least exposed path from west periphery to east periphery is then equivalent to the problem of finding the least weight path from a to b on this grid .
Such a path can be efficiently determined using the Dijkstra"s shortest path algorithm [1] .
A pseudo code of the overall algorithm is shown in Figure 2 .
Example
Assume the noise process at each sensor is Additive White Gaussian with mean 0 and variance 1 .
Further assume that the sensors use value fusion to arrive at a consensus decision .
Then, from Equation 2, we chose a threshold £b = 3.0 to achieve a false alarm probability of 0.187% .
The field has been divided into a 10 ¡Ñ 10 grid .
The target emits an energy K = 12 and the energy decay factor is 2 .
The figure shows the weight assigned to each line segment in the grid as described above .
The least exposure path found by the Dijkstra"s algorithm for this weighted grid is highlighted .
