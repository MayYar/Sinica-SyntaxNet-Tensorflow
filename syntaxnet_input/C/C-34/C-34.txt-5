SENSOR NETWORKS TO H(K,U,M,V,N) Obviously, from the description in section 3 and 4, we can know that the clusters deployed sensor network can be mapped into a klevels hierarchical hypercube model as follows
Then, the sensor nodes in each cluster can be encoded with the In Cluster Hypercube Node Codes, and the sensor nodes in the k different clusters with the same In ClusterHypercube Node Codes can be encoded with the Out ClusterHypercube Node Codes according to the definition 5 respectively .
Consequently, the whole sensor network has been mapped into a k levels hierarchical hypercube model. .
