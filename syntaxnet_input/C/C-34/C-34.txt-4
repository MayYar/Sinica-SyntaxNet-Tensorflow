Definition 5 (k levels Hierarchical Hypercube)
So we can obtain k such kind of different hypercubes .
2) The k different hypercubes obtained above are encoded as j1j2¡Kjm, which are called Out Cluster Hypercube Node Codes, where 0 ? j1,j2,¡Kjm ? u 1,u=[ m k ] .
And the nodes in the k different hypercubes are connected into m dimensional hypercubes according to the following rules
(The graph constructed through above steps is called a k levels Hierarchical Hypercube abbreviated as H(k,u,m,v,n).) 3) Any node A in H(k,u,m,v,n) can be encoded as (i, j), where i(i=i1i2¡Kin, 0 ? i1,i2,¡Kin ? v 1) is the In Cluster HypercubeNode Code of node A, and j(j=j1j2¡Kjm, 0 ? j1,j2,¡Kjm ? u 1) is the Out Cluster Hypercube Node Code of node A .
Obviously, the H(k,u,m,v,n) model has the following good properties

Property 2
