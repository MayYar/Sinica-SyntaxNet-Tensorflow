 ABSTRACT 
As the idea of virtualisation of compute power, storage and bandwidth becomes more and more important, grid computing evolves and is applied to a rising number of applications .
The environment for decentralized adaptive services provides a grid like infrastructure for user accessed, longterm services (e.g .
webserver, source code repository etc.) .
It aims at supporting the autonomous execution and evolution of services in terms of scalability and resource aware distribution .
EDAS offers flexible service models based on distributed mobile objects ranging from a traditional clientserver scenario to a fully peer to peer based approach .
Automatic, dynamic resource management allows optimized use of available resources while minimizing the administrative complexity .
