The straightforward algorithm for solving the divisible matching problem is linear programming; we set up an appropriate linear program in Section 5.1 .
The straightforward algorithm for solving the indivisible matching problem is integer programming .
With n events, to set up the appropriate linear or integer programs, simply writing out the payoff vectors in the straightforward way requires O(2n ) space .
There is some hope that specialized algorithms that exploit structure among bids can perform better in terms of average case time and space complexity .
For example, in some cases matches can be identified using logical reduction techniques, without writing down the full payoff vectors .
So a match between the following bids
Formalizing a logical reduction algorithm for matching, or other algorithms that can exploit special structure among the bids, is a promising avenue for future work. .
