The logical question to ask in light of these complexity results is whether further, more severe restrictions on the space of securities can enable tractable matching algorithms .
Although we have not systematically explored the possibilities, the potential for useful tractable cases certainly exists .
Suppose, for example, that bids are limited to unit quantities of securities of the following two forms
