Our algorithmic result presents an intriguing heuristic in practice
Of course the scenario does change, however, and so coming up with a stochastic bidding strategy remains an important open direction, explored somewhat by [11, 13]
Another interesting generalization is to consider weights on the clicks, which is a way to model conversions
(A conversion corresponds to an action on the part of the user who clicked through to the advertiser site; e.g., a sale or an account sign up.) Finally, we have looked at this system as a black box returning clicks as a function of bid, whereas in reality it is a complex repeated game involving multiple advertisers
In [3], it was shown that when a set of advertisers use a strategy similar to the one we suggest here, under a slightly modified first price auction, the prices approach a well understood market equilibrium
