The field of Algorithmic Mechanism Design handles the issue of private information held by the different parties in such computational settings .
This paper deals with a complementary problem in such settings
Our model is a combinatorial variant of the classical principal agent problem from economic theory .
In our setting a principal must motivate a team of strategic agents to exert costly effort on his behalf, but their actions are hidden from him .
Our focus is on cases where complex combinations of the efforts of the agents influence the outcome .
The principal motivates the agents by offering to them a set of contracts, which together put the agents in an equilibrium point of the induced game .
We present formal models for this setting, suggest and embark on an analysis of some basic issues, but leave many questions open .
